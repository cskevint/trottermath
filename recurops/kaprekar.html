     No, that is not someone's telephone number up there in the title of this piece.  It is the name of a numerical puzzle guaranteed to spark wonder and amazement in the minds of your students.  It is
called  <b>Kaprekar's</b> (pronounced kuh-PREE-kur) Constant*.  This little, mysterious math activity is one of a family of math procedures called <b>Recurrent Operations</b>.
<p>
     Recurrent operations are repetitive procedures wherein each intermediate result (i.e. sum, difference, etc.) is used in turn
until a specific outcome is ultimately obtained.  The procedure to work the Kaprekar sort of "magic" is as follows:
<pre>
<p>
   1.	Select a four-digit number, for example, <font color="#0033FF">5634</font>.

   2.	Form a new number from this number by rearranging the
	digits in decreasing order, e.g. <font color="#0033FF">6543</font>.

   3.	Reverse the number obtained in Step 2, then subtract the
	smaller number from the larger one.

			  	  6543
				<u>- 3456</u>
			  	  <font color="#0033FF">3087</font>

   4.	Take the difference just obtained and repeat the procedure
	in Step 2 and 3; that is, order the digits, reverse, and
	subtract.  This should be continued until the surprise hits
	you.

		  8730		  8532		  7641
		<u>- 0378</u>		<u>- 2358</u>		<u>- 1467</u>
		  <font color="#0033FF">8352</font>		  <font color="#FF0000">6174</font>		  <font color="#FF0000">6174</font>
</pre>
     Do you notice that with <font color="#FF0000">6174</font> the process comes to a "stand-still"?  That is, <font color="#FF0000">6174</font> just yields itself!
<p>
     But the real surprise is yet to come.
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
     Try the procedure on <u>any</u> other four-digit number.  It always ends with <font color="#FF0000">6174</font>.  This is a famous number in the field of recreational mathematics; it's called <B>Kaprekar's Constant</B>.

     Students find this discovery quite fascinating and unexpected, so much so that they don't even realize that one of your instructional objectives is to provide some practice in subtraction skills.  But
more importantly you can now use this opportunity as a springboard for
further exploration by posing the following questions to them:
<pre>
<p>
   1.	Who can find a number that requires the greatest number
	of subtractions to obtain <font color="#FF0000">6174</font>?

   2.	What happens if the Kaprekar process is applied to three-
	digit or five-digit numbers?  (Dare we ask about still
	larger numbers?)

   3.	What happens if numbers in bases other than ten are used?
	For example, 4-digit numbers in "base 5".

   4.	Why does the game not work on such numbers as 3,333 or 888?

     Many things could be said in favor of such activities from a pedagogical viewpoint, but only one will be mentioned here.  Due to the strangeness of the whole situation and the interest created thereby, it causes the student to generate his own "problem set" of several exercises, based from only one or two starting numbers.  That is to say, by asking him to do "only one or two problems", he eventually does quite a few individual exercises -- and enjoys it all the while.
<p> 
     One final note: if experience in systematic discovery is of more value to your instructional goals than merely subtraction practice, Questions #1 and #2 above make excellent investigations for pocket calculators.
