&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Ms. Powers was leading a class discussion about square numbers, Absent-minded Alvin was in another "world", looking for interesting patterns in the topic.  Shortly, he raised his hand and said, "Ms. Powers, I've found something rather nice.  Look.  If I take 2 consecutive squares and subtract them, the difference is always the sum of 2 consecutive integers."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Show the class what you mean by that, Alvin," said the teacher.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin wrote the following on the board:
<p>
<center><b><big>49 - 36 = 13 and 13 = 6 + 7
<p>
64 - 49 = 15 and 15 = 7 + 8</big></b></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the class, he shyly said, "I call this '<i>Alvin's Theorem</i>'."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Powers smiled and said, "Very good, but if you want to call it a theorem, you must be able to prove it is always true for all numbers, using algebra."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alvin replied, "Oh yes, I can do that too.  Here's how."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did Alvin write on the board now?
