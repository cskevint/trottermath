    <h3>Background</h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latter part of May of this year (2001) we discovered a very interesting website all about prime numbers, titled appropriately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050501005345/http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/">The Prime Pages</a>.  There is a companion page connected with it, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050501005345/http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/curios/">Prime Curios</a>, a collection of clever and interesting trivia, moderated by G. L. Honaker, Jr.  It is to this 2nd site that this WTM page is concerned.
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, we began submitting our own contributions right away.  First, we sent the one about 1992 that appears at the beginning.  Then others began to follow in rapid succession.  The list soon grew rather lengthy, so we decided to place ours in one location.  So what you will see and read below is the results of our number play since that time.  Nothing is in any particular order, unless otherwise indicated.
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each entry in the list is preceded by a link (the highlighted number) that will take you to the specific page in the website of Prime Curios, so that you may read all the other interesting facts that other people found about that particular number.  We think you will be quite surprised and well rewarded.
    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So go forward now, and most of all, have fun with numbers!

The only other two years in the period 1000 to 1999 to share the structure of "a x b x 'ab'" (where 'ab' is prime and the concatenation of the factors a and b) are 1316 = 4 x 7 x 47 and 1533 = 7 x 3 x 73.</li><br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This next group of 7 items is the result of some email correspondence we had with <b>Carlos Rivera</b> (6/27/01).  [See <a href="potpourri.html">Potpourri</a> for that email.] We posed the basic idea, and Carlos provided us with the numbers.  (See above on 36 and 8 for the cases of square and cube.)

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we present some items that are harder to categorize.  The first one was created by the moderator of Prime Curios, <b>G. L. Honaker, Jr.</b>, after we wrote our webpage on <a href="trotprims1.html">Trotter Numbers and Trotter Primes</a>.  The second one is a two-person contribution, involving <b>Monte Zerger</b> (whose name and creations can be found in other WTM pages) and ourselves (WTM).
