<div align="left">     Recently (June 2001) I became aware of an interesting website, dedicated to the discovery and reporting of appearances of the number 47 in our world.  It is called, appropriately enough, the <a href="http://www.47.net/47society/">47 Society</a>.  They post e-mail notes from the members about any trivia related to what they claim is the "quintessential random number".  Well, if you have read the pages of WTM, it should come as no surprise to you that I "enlisted" in the society.  And on June 8, I wrote my first e-mail to them, which said:</div><br>
<p>
<hr noshade color="0000FF" width=50%>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div align="left">Hey, I like your neat project about 47.  While I'm not quite ready to believe that 47 is the only number worth looking for, :>) , I  do enjoy looking for number facts of any kind.</div><br>

<div align="left">So here's my humble contribution...</div><br>

<div align="left">About 9 years ago I wrote a letter that was published in the Nov. '92 issue of the MATHEMATICS TEACHER (NCTM) about "1992".  You see, 1992 = 8 x 3 x 83.  But also in the past thousand years only 2 other years had that same structure: a x b x 'ab'.  They were 1533 = 7 x 3 x 73 and (ta-dah!) 1316 = 4 x 7 x 47.</div><br>

<div align="left">This morning as I lay in bed thinking about "47" (yes, this is true), it struck me that "47" was the concatenation of "4" [a square; I like squares, too] and "7" [the "ubiquitous 7", as I like to say].  So I began examining other such cases.</div><br>

<div align="left">We get 17, 47, 97, 167, 257, 367, ... all primes so far.  [But of course, 497 isn't prime, but that was sorta to be expected.]  Some future terms from here on are primes, while others are not.</div><br>

<div align="left">BUT 47 is the 2nd prime in this sequence, and 2 is the only even prime.  So that might count for something, huh?</div><br>

<div align="left">[Which brings to mind this quote:  All primes are odd except 2--which is therefore the <i>oddest</i> of them all. [Knuth] ]</div><br>

<div align="left">I hope you like this, and I'll keep my eye out for more 47's, okay?</div><br>

<div align="left">     That little comment about the sequence of numbers containing the number <font size=5 color="FF0000">47</font> was the inspiration of all that follows in this article.  I warn you -- it gets wild at times.  Enjoy.</div><br>

<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>
<div align="left">     The set of <b><font face="comic sans ms">Trotter Numbers</font></b> is a subset of the natural numbers, or positive integers, defined by the following rule:</div><br>

<center><font size=5><b>T(n) = 10 * n<sup>2</sup> + 7, where n = 1, 2, 3, </b></font></center><br>

<div align="left">     The sequence begins: 17, 47, 97, 167, 257, 367, 497, </div><br>

<div align="left">     Whenever a given T(n) [aka TN] is <b>prime</b>, it shall be called a <b><font face="comic sans ms">Trotter Prime</font></b> (TP).</div><br>

<div align="left">     After a few moments of close observation and reflection, one should notice that while the first six consecutive TN's given are <b>prime</b>, the 7<sup>th</sup> one, 497, is a composite number.  It is equal to 7 × 71.  This characteristic alone, that in the TN sequence -- unlike the sequence of natural numbers -- primes can be consecutive, makes the set of Trotter Numbers interesting.</div><br>   

<div align="left">     However, while it is quite easy to expect that among the infinite number of TN's, some will be prime and some will be composite, you still have to test each TN to see if it is also a TP.</div><br>  

<div align="left">     Lucky for us: we can easily prove that every 7<sup>th</sup> one can <b>not</b> be prime.  Hence, there can never be a string of TP's longer than 6.  The question merely remains: do strings of 5, 4, or 3 TP's exist?  If so, where are they?  That is what you, as the great prime hunter, must do -- <i><b>find 'em, and tag 'em!</b></i></div><br>

<p>
<div align="left">     This is where we stop on this page.  Now it's up to you.  You must start investigating the topic of Trotter Numbers and Trotter Primes before you turn the page, as it were, to see what patterns or odd tid-bits of trivia you can find, then compare your results with what WTM has discovered so far.</div><br>

     When you finish with your reseach, collect all your notes together, and turn to <a href="trotprims2.html">Page 2</a>.  Thank you and good luck!

P.S.  WTM is rather pleased to state that the sequence given above can be found in Sloane's <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/">On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> and has its own reference number: A061722.
