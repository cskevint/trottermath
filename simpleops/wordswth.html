     "What's it worth?" is a common question in the business world to be sure.  But what about a math classroom?  The question of "What is the value of CAT or DOG?" certainly sounds intriguing to me and to
elementary students I have taught.  The idea becomes obvious if we give each letter its own value and we just add up the values of each letter to obtain the value of the word.
<p>
     For starters, let's give the letters the value of their positions in the alphabet:
<p>
<center><h2>A = 1,   B = 2,   C = 3,  ...  ,   Y = 25,   Z = 26</h2></center>
<p>
     Now, here is how things turn out for some common 3-letter words:<br>
<pre>
	C =  3		D =  4		F =  6		F =  6
	A =  1		O = 15		A =  1		L = 12
	T = <u>20</u>		G = <u> 7</u>		N = <u>14</u>		Y = <u>25</u>
	    24		    26		    21		    43
</pre>
<p>
<center><img src="Colorbar.gif" width=350 height=3></center>
<p>
<h2>Where's the Challenge?</h2>

     Finding the value sums for three-letter words is, admittedly, not a great and difficult thing to do.  So, why am I presenting this
with such fanfare?  It's because if we reverse things -- á la JEOPARDY -- and ask, "Can you find a word that is worth 50 points?  Or 25 points?  What word has the greatest/smallest value?" etc., then things become an experience in true problem solving.  It's not so easy now, is it?
<p>
     One sort of activity I have used is to ask the class, working as a team, to find words for each value number from some lower limit to some upper limit.  For example, let's start out with 3-letter words.
I have found word sums as low as <font color="#0000FF">6</font> (<font color="#FF0000">CAB</font>) and as high as <font color="#0000FF">66</font> (<font color="#FF0000">WRY</font>) -- and of course, every number inbetween.
<p>
     As one begins such a project, it is convenient to just start putting down any 3-letter words that come to mind, compute their values, and compile an ordered list, leaving blank those numbers for which no
value has been found so far.  As spaces are filling up, soon you will start directing your attention towards the missing values.  Then is when the fun -- and the challenge -- begins.
<p>
     One suggestion would be to make a large poster on the bulletin board with a chart in this form:
<p>
</pre>
<center>
<table border=2 cellpadding=10>

<tr bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
<td>No.</td><td>Word</td><td>Expression</td><td>Name</td><td>Date</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>6</td><td>CAB</td><td>3+1+2</td><td>John S.</td><td>Sept 10</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>7</td><td>BAD</td><td>2+1+4</td><td>Mary J.</td><td>Sept. 11</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>8</td><td>CAD</td><td>3+1+4</td><td>Ann P.</td><td>Sept. 12</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>9</td><td>DAD</td><td>4+1+4</td><td>Sue W.</td><td>Sept. 10</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>10</td><td>BAG</td><td>2+1+7</td><td>Bill M.</td><td>Sept. 11</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<b><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></b>
</tr>

</table>
</center>
<p>

     [If you are using cooperative grouping in your class, this would make a good activity for students working in this way.  And for the independent individual, he or she can do this "all by oneself".  In
such structures, the chart is still a good recording strategy.]

<h3>Trivia Fun</h3>

     Sometimes as a large body of word values are compiled, you can find interesting equal-value-pairs.  In my not very extensive collection to date, I have noted this nice pair: <font color="#FF0000">FOX</font> and <font color="#FF0000">FUR</font>, both words having a total of <font color="#0000FF">45</font>, and the words themselves have an obvious connection in the real world.  You and your students can surely find additional cases like this one.  This is definitely a case of "two heads are better than one"; when large word lists are compiled, more interesting gems can be discovered by cooperating together.
<p>
     By way of introducing the concept and formal notation of inequality, we can make light-hearted statements such as
<p>
<center><h2>CAT  <  DOG</h2></center>
<p>
     [Lest I start receiving angry email from the cat lovers of the world, I offer the following inequality to put things in perspective:
<p>
<h3><center>CAT  <  DOG  <  FOX</center></h3>
<p>
Okay?]
<p>
     How about some numerical fun...
<p>
<center><h2>SIX  <  TWO</h2></center>
<center><img src="Colorbar.gif" width=350 height=3></center>
<h3>Go for FOUR</h3>

     Of course, there's no rule that says you must limit yourself to 3-letter words; there are many more 4-letter words out there just waiting to be "valued"!  My limit numbers so far go from <font color="#0000FF">10</font> (<font color="#FF0000">BABE</font>) to
<font color="#0000FF">79</font> (<font color="#FF0000">FUZZ</font>).
<p>
     And you say you want some trivia in this category?  Here is one of my favorites: "<b>MORE is less than LESS, MUCH is less than MORE and much less than LESS, whereas LOTS is lots more than all three of those.</b>"  Show this to be true by finding their values and writing out the appropriate inequality statement.
<p>
     And this one has a unique flavor all its own:
<p>
<center><h2>SHOE   +   1   =   SOCK</h2></center>

     Returning for a moment to our numerical case above, what sort of inequality should we write here for <b>FOUR</b> and <b>FIVE</b>?
<p>

<center><img src="Colorbar.gif" width=350 height=3></center>
<p>
<B>And on it goes...</b>
<p>
     I'm sure you're beginning to see the possiblities for extending this activity as long as interest holds up.  Contests could be on-going for extended periods of time for such ideas as<br>
<ul>
<li>the smallest value for 10-letter words;<br>
<li>the largest value for 10-letter words;<br>
<li>finding related words with the same or consecutive values;<br>
<li>a short sentence (3 words or so) with equal-valued words.<br>
</ul><br>
     The possibilities are limited only by one's own creativity.

<font size=4>Update:</font> <b>7/31/01</b>
<p>
     We have just finished researching the matter of applying this activity to the last names of the <font color="ff0000" size=4>43</font> <b>Presidents of the United States</b>.  We feel we have found some interesting data worth sharing.  Most of our data involves <b>prime numbers</b>.
<p>
     First, there are 9 Presidents who numerical values are primes, ranging from <b>Ford</b> (<font color="0000ff">43</font>) to the two <b>Roosevelts</b> (<font color="0000ff">131</font> each).  The other 6 remaining prime totals are:
<p>
<center><font color="0000ff" size=5>47, 61, 73, 79, 83, and 97</font></center>.
<p>
     Can you connect each number with its corresponding President?
<p>
<hr noshade width=50% color="ff0000">
<p>
     Second, if we add up the various individual totals from <b>Washington</b> up to another President, we get several more primes, in fact, this happens 7 times.  Here are the results:
<p>
<center><table border=0 cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>
<ol>
<li><font color="ff0000">241</font>, up to Monroe;
<li><font color="ff0000">811</font>, up to Tyler;
<li><font color="ff0000">2087</font>, up to Roosevelt (Teddy);
<li><font color="ff0000">2287</font>, up to Harding;
<li><font color="ff0000">2357</font>, up to Coolidge;
<li><font color="ff0000">2857</font>, up to Kennedy; and finally,
<li><font color="0000ff" size=5>3371</font>, up to <font color="0000ff">BUSH!</font> (the newest one!)
</ol>
</td></td>
</table></center>
     [Note: Just so there is no confusion.  Since Cleveland served 2 non-consecutive presidencies (22nd and 24th), his name is used twice to compute the totals.]
<p>
<hr noshade width=50% color="ff0000">
<p>
     Finally, we'd like to mention two other interesting numbers that showed up.  The squares of <font color="0000ff">64</font> and <font color="0000ff">121</font> are the values for <b>Buchanan</b> and <b>Eisenhower</b>, respectively.
