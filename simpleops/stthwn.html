      <b>Part I</b> 
    </center>
    <pre>
    
     <strong> 1. 	Arrange the first eight digits in order, like this:
    
    
            1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, 6, 7, 8
    
    
        Now, we can add some symbols to make true facts:
    
    
            12 = 3 x 4 and 56 = 7 x 8
    
    
      2.	It is possible to make true and complete multiplication problems
        (that is, make the factors AND the product) in the two following
        unusual ways:
    
    
          a)  Use only the first five digits <i>once and only once</i>;
              that is, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
    
          b)  Use only the first five <u>odd</u> digits <i>once and only once</i>;
              that is, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
    
        Can you find the whole problem for each case?
    
    
      3.	Multiply 21978 by 4; then look at your answer to see a <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font>
        thing.
    
    
      4.	Multiply 10989 by 9; then look at your answer to see a <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font>
        thing.
    
    
      5.	Multiply 421,052,631,578,947,368 by 2; then look at your answer
        to see a <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> thing.
    
    
      6.	Take the digits 1, 2, and 3 and make all the two-place numbers
        possible; use each digit only <i>once</i> per number. (There will be
        <u>six</u> such numbers.)  Add up these numbers to see a <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> thing.
    
        Do the same again, first using the digits 2, 4, and 6. Then
        try 3, 6, and 9.
    
        Will this happen with <u>any</u> three different digits? (No, there
        are no more in the 3-digit range.)
    
    
      7.	The year 1962 was a <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> year. To see just how <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font>, do
        the following steps as directed:
    
          a)  Find 1/2 (one-half) of 1962; it = __________.
    
          b)  Find 1/3 (one-third) of 1962; it = __________.
    
          c)  Find 1/6 (one-sixth) of 1962; it = __________.
    
          d)  Add those three answers here.----> __________.
    
        For an added <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> bonus look at the individual digits that
        were in your three addends (a, b, and c).
    
    
    </strong><center><strong>Part II</strong></center><strong>
    
      1.	Write the first ten prime numbers in order, as shown (Note: the
        11 is used twice):
    
          2, 3, 5, 7, 11      
    
        11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
    
        Now, by putting in some symbols for multiplication, addition,
        and squaring, we have
    
          2 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 11      
    
        11^2 + 13^2 + 17^2 + 19^2 + 23^2 + 29^2
    
        Figure out the two parts to see which side is larger in value.
    
    
      2.	Multiply 11,826 by itself and look at your answer to see a
        <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> thing.
    
        The same <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> thing also happens with 30,384. But just
        what is the product anyway?
    
    
      3.	Take the number 153. Find the cube (3rd power) of each of
        the three digits. Add up these three values to see a <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font>
        thing.
    
        The same <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> thing also happens with these numbers: 370,
        371, and 407. Can you find any more?
    
    
      4.	Now we will try the same sort of thing with the following numbers.
        BUT this time you are to first find the <u>fourth</u> power of each digit
        before adding.  (Warning: only some of the numbers below actually
        work.  Which ones are they?)
    
          a)   1634	b)  2451    c)  8208     d)  9474     e)  5072
    
    
      5.	Do you want to go for <u>fifth</u> powers now?  Okay, good. First, find
        the <u>fifth</u> power of each digit, then add up the resulting values.
        (Gee, aren't numbers <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> acting sometimes?)
    
          a)  4150    b)  54,748    c)  22,132   d)  4151    e) 1145
    
        Did they all work, or not?
    
    
    </strong><center><strong>Part III</strong></center><strong>
    
      1.	Find the values of the following powers.  Then add up the digits
        of the final product to see a <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> thing.
     
          a)  17^3       b)  18^3       c)  27^3       d)  26^3
    
        (As an example of this idea, use 8^3. 
        8^3 = 512 and 5 + 1 + 2 = 8.
        Do you see it now?)
    
        <font face="comic sans ms">Strange</font> as this may be, it can even work with certain fourth
        powers, too.  Try it with 7, 22, and 25.
    
        Would you believe FIFTH powers, too?  By now, you'll probably
        believe anything, right?  Well, it's true!  Try it with these
        numbers: 28 and 35.
    
      2.	There is something very <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> about these pairs of consecutive
        numbers.  To see what it is, first find the squares of each one
        in the pair, then look closely at the digits in the products.
        <font face="comic sans ms">Strange</font>, isn't it?
    
          a)  13 & 14	    b)  157 & 158	c)  913 & 914
    
    
      3.	On we go with more <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> things...these are rather easy.
        Just perform the indicated operations.  Then compare your
        final answer with what you started with.
    
          a)  12^2  +   33^2  =		b)  88^2  +  33^2  =
    
          c)  10^2  +  100^2  =		d)  588^2  +  2353^2  =
    
    
      4.	Here's a weird one, for sure.  Pay careful attention now.
        First, 	do the multiplication problems that are below.  Then,
        reverse the big factor (the 5-place number) and try to find a 
        one-place number that when it and the reversed factor are
        multiplied, you get the same product that you found the first
        time.  Try it---it's not so bad afterall.
    
          a)  10989 x 9 =		d)  43956 x 6 =
    
          b)  21978 x 8 =		e)  54945 x 5 =
    
          c)  32967 x 7 =
    
    
    </strong><center><strong>Part IV</strong></center><strong>
    
      1.	Here is another <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> thing that involves all nine digits
        from 1 to 9.
    
        If you find the square of <font color="#FF0000">567</font>, the product will contain only
        the six other digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9).  But, what is
        that product?
    
        The same kind of thing happens with <font color="#FF0000">854</font>.  What is the six-
        digit square number this time?
    
    
      2.	The square of <font color="#FF0000">428</font> is 183,184.  This product has the <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font>
        property that if the six digits are separated into two halves,
        we have the consecutive 3-place numbers 183 and 184.
    
        This is a rare thing, to be sure.  In fact, the only numbers
        whose squares have this property are mixed into the list of
        numbers below.  Some of them work; some don't.
    
        So, tell me which ones work, and give the <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> product.
    
           573         625         727         846         904
    
    
      3.	Study this true number sentence for a moment:
    
                 1  + 2  + 6 = 4  +  5
    
        Now, believe it or not, if we square each number, then add,
        both sides will STILL be equal!  Look...
    
                 1^2 + 2^2 + 6^2 = 4^2 + 5^2
                 1  + 4 + 36 = 16 + 25
                      41 = 41
    
        That, you will have to admit, is rather <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font>.
    
        Of course, by now you know these <font face="comic sans ms">strange</font> things just don't
        happen all the time.  So, below you will find several true
        number sentences.  BUT the <i>square number</i> versions may or may
        not be like the example above.
    
        So, for those that are true both ways, show me why they are
        (that is, find the squares and the equal totals).
    
            1 + 8 + 9 = 3 + 4 + 11
    
            7 + 9 + 12 = 6 + 10 + 13
    
            2 + 7 + 10 = 4 + 6 + 9
    
            2 + 7 + 9 = 3 + 5 + 10
    
            1 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 2 + 4 + 6 + 10
    
            5 + 7 + 7 + 8 = 3 + 4 + 6 + 14
    
            1 + 5 + 8 + 12 = 2 + 3 + 10 + 11
    
    
    </strong><center><strong>Part V</strong></center><strong>
    
      1.	Try this.  Pick the name of any number you wish.  Count the
        number of letters that are in it.  Write that number as a
        word again.  Do the counting part again.  Keep on doing this
        until a <u>surprise</u> strikes you.
    
        Here is an example to explain the idea:
    
          <font color="#FF0000">THIRTY-THREE</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">ELEVEN</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">SIX</font> ==> <font color="#336600">(go on...)</font>
    
    
        Do this with at least five different number names.  Be sure
        to try some "BIG" numbers.  What result(s) do you find?
    
    
      2.	Pick any number.  If it is <I>even</I>, cut it in half (divide by 2).
        If it is <I>odd</I>, multiply it by 3, then add 1.  Continue with
        these two rules with each new answer you get, until a <u>surprise</u>
        shows up.
    
        Here are two examples:
    
          a)  <font color="#FF0000">13</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">40</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">20</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">10</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">5</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">16</font> ==> <font color="#336600">(go on...)</font>
    
    
          b) <font color="#FF0000">106</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">53</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">160</font> ==> <font color="#FF0000">80</font> ==> <font color="#336600">(go on...)</font>
    
    
        Do this with five more numbers that you choose.  What result(s)
        do you find?
    
    
      3.	Pick any number.  Find the square of each of its digits; then
        add those digits.  Take the sum and continue the process, over
        and over, until a <u>surprise</u> shows up.
    
        Here are two examples:
    
          a)  18     1     36     36      9     25
                      <u>+ 64</u>   <u>+ 25</u>   <u>+  1</u>   <u>+ 49</u>   <u>+ 64</u>   <font color="#336600">(go on...)</font>
    
                65     61     37     58     89
    
    
          b)  1333    1      4     36
                  9   <u>+ 64</u>   <u>+ 64</u>    <font color="#336600">(go on...)</font>
                  9     68    100
                <u>+ 9</u>
                 28
    
        Do this process with these six numbers and tell what results
        you find.  Then pick your own number (make it greater than
        1000) and do the process on it.
    
          A)    92	B)   4208       C)   23
    
          D)   153	E)  54,151	F)  657

    <div style="color: purple; border-radius: 10px; width:75%; padding:15px; margin:10px auto;background-color:lightpink;">This article was missing from my original archive of the website but thankfully I found a copy of it on this website (<a href="https://www.guardiansofdarkness.org/GoD/trotter.html">https://www.guardiansofdarkness.org/GoD/trotter.html</a>) along with a tribute to my father and some additional <i>strange things that happen with numbers...</i> I fondly remember this content because as a young child I remember a floppy disk that my father had is his disk box labeled "S.T.T.H.W.N." and I was so curious about what was in it. My dad explained a few times but I don't think I fully understood until I was a bit older. -Kevin Trotter (May 13, 2024)</div>
