The following item appeared in the "From the File" section of The ARITHMETIC TEACHER, October 1983, p.  53.  Later it was referenced in other NCTM publications.<P>

<center><B><H1>PRODUCT DATES</H1></B></center><P>

     Here is a novel activity that can be used with selected dates---for example, March 27, 1981---which might be introduced to the class in the following way:<P>

     "Today is a special day for mathematicians.  To see why, let's write the date in the usual brief form, 3/27/81.  Notice that we can also state this as a multiplication sentence, 3 Ã— 27 = 81.  Interesting, wouldn't you say!  Let's call this a <I><B>product date</B></I>.  Are there any more product dates in 1981?"<P>

After students have had time to explore this question and find answers, the following questions can be posed:<P>
<ol>
<li>Did last year have any product dates?  If so, when?<BR><br>
<li>Will next year have any product dates?  If so, when?<BR><br>
<li>Did your birthday fall on a product date?<BR><br>
<li>How many product dates are there in any specific decade, say, the 1970s, the 1960s, and so on. List them.<BR><br>
<li>The BIG question: How many product dates are there in a <U>whole</U> <U>century</U>?  List them.<P>
</ol>
