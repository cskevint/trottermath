	This page presents two numerical games appropriate for students
at the upper elementary grade levels -- 3rd to 6th grades.  In each
game, use of calculators is presumed to be part of the setting, mostly
to speed up play and to guarantee greater accuracy of the computations
involved.  It has been my observation that many students at this level
lack the necessary familiarity needed with this technology.  So these
games are merely intended to give the students an environment in which
they can use calculators in an enjoyable way, yet build up their skills
at the same time.

<h2>The Product Game</h2>
</center>

	There are two players for this game; each one needs a pencil,
paper and a calculator.

<h3>RULES</h3>

  1.  Each player forms a pair of numbers using the digits 1, 2,
      3, 4, and 5, once and only once.  This is done simultaneously
      and out of sight of each other.  One number thus formed will
      contain three digits; the other will contain two digits.

		Example:	2 4 1
				<u>× 3 5</u>

  2.  Each player computes his own product.

  3.  Then the <i>difference</i> of the two products is found.

  4.  Points are awarded in the following manner:

	a.  If the difference between the products is 1000 or
	    more, the player who made the <b>larger</b> product scores
	    <b>5</b> points.

	b.  If the difference between the products is less than
	    1000, the player who made the <b>smaller</b> product scores
	    <b>10</b> points.

  5.  The first player to score <b>50 or more</b> points is declared the
      winner.

  6.  <b>NOTE:</b> To make the game more challenging and fair, no number formed
      should ever be used twice.  So keeping a record of what numbers
      have been used is important.

<h3>SAMPLE ROUNDS</h3>
<font color="FF0000">
	A:	235 × 14 = 3290		Difference = 5134

	B:	351 × 24 = 8424		B gets 5 points
</font>
<font color="0000FF">
	A:	423 × 15 = 6345		Difference = 135

	B:	432 × 15 = 6480		A gets 10 points
</font>

	The game may be varied in different ways.  One is by changing
the digits used to another set of five: (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) or
(1, 3, 5, 7, 9) for example.  Another might be to change the scoring
of points to something like "15 points go to the player with the
larger product whenever the difference is greater than 5000".  [This
is added to the previous two scoring rules, however.]  Or dream up your
own adaptions.

<h2>The Sum-of-Squares Game</h2>
</center>

	This game is similar to, yet different from, the previously
described game.  It is similar in its scoring system, i.e. the big vs.
small aspect.  The differences are that addition is the operation to
be used and the squares of the numbers from 10 to 31 are numbers that
will be added.  The reason I have selected these particular squares
has already been discussed in my page <a href="worldsqr.html">It's a Square, Square World</a>.

	Prior to playing this game, a deck of 3-by-5 cards need to be
prepared with the twenty-two squares written on one side.  It is
recommended that each card carry the information written in this form:
</pre>
<center>
<table border=3 cellpadding=10 bgcolor="FFFFFF">
<tr><td>	
<font color="0033CC">12<sup>2</sup> = 144</font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<pre>
After that, the same equipment as for the other game are required.


<h3>RULES</h3>

  1.  The cards are placed face down spread out on a table; perhaps
      they may be shuffled as well before doing this step.

  2.  Each player takes turn in selecting two cards.

  3.  The sum of the two squares is then calculated.

  4.  Next, the difference of the sums is calculated.

  5.  Points are awarded in the following manner:

	a.  If the difference between the sums is 500 or
	    more, the player who made the <b>larger</b> sum
            scores <b>5</b> points.

	b.  If the difference between the sums is less than
	    500, the player who made the <b>smaller</b> sum
            scores <b>10</b> points.

  6.  These cards are put aside and the process is repeated with
      the remaining cards.  This would mean three more rounds
      before the cards need to be collected and reshuffled.  [<i>This
      is to promote familiarity for each player with as many of the
      squares as possible throughout a game</i>.]

  7.  The first player to score <b>50 or more</b> points is declared the
      winner.

	This game can likewise take on different variations.  One is
that three cards at a time could be selected to form the sum.  Another
is that all (or some) of the cards could be dealt to each player in
typical "poker" style, giving the player the opportunity to select
which cards he/she desires to use in given round of play.  Again, you
may be the designer of your own variation.
