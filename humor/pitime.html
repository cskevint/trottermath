&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most people in school math classes are aware of a special event day, called Pi Day.  It's usually observed on or about March 14 of the year.  This is because the usual way to write that date is 3/14, and the usual approximation of <b>&#960;</b> is <b>3.14</b>.  To learn about some nice ways to observe the "pi" moment, read the article <a href="/personal/piday.html">"Let's Take Another Look At Pi Day"</a> found in this website.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page takes up the matter once again, but with an interesting twist, we think. 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we must introduce another math concept, one not so familiar to many people: the <i><font color="red"><b>greatest integer function</b></font></i>.  Simply explained, given any number that has a "decimal" part, like 5.26 for example, the greatest integer of 5.26 is <b>5</b>, the part to the left of the decimal point.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematicians have a special notation to express this.  Using our example above, they would do it like this:
<p>
<big><center><b>[ </b>5.26<b> ]</b> = 5</center></big>.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now bringing in <b>&#960;</b> again, we could say:
<p>
<big><center><b>[</b> &#960; <b>]</b> = 3</center></big>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we don't intend to stop there.  Watch what happens if we insert the number 100 in the following way:
<p>
<big><center><b>[</b> 100&#960; <b>]</b> = 314</center></big>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is certainly true because as <b>&#960;</b> begins 3.141592, then 100 times that number would be 314.1592  And the rest is obvious.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new number of 314 can lead us to some new explorations.  My first thought is this:
<p>
<center><b><big>What is the 314<sup>th</sup> day of a year?</big></b></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since a year has 365 days (366 in leap years), there must be a day that is #314, no?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's not stop here either.  
<p>
<center><b>What is the 314<sup>th</sup> hour of the year?</b></center>  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously it must occur in January, but on what day and at what specific hour?   Return to the month of March, when Pi Day is normally celebrated.  
<p>
<center><b>What is the 314<sup>th</sup> hour of that month?  </b></center>
<p>
We're on a roll now!  
<p>
Additional ideas that spring to mind could include:
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What is the 314<sup>th</sup> minute, or second, of a given day?  (Give time in <i>hh:mm:ss</i> form.)
<li>When will the 314<sup>th</sup> week, or month, occur in a given decade? (State on what day of which month that week would start.)
<li>When were you, dear reader, 314 days (or weeks or months) old?
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one said we had to use 100 as our power of 10 above, right?  So, what would happen if we investigated the possibilities of these expressions?
<p>
<center><b><big>[ 1000&#960; ]</big></b> 
<p>
or
<p>
<big><b>[ 10000&#960; ]</b></big></center> 
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you can begin to see the possibilities for your own creativity, right?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest integer function is sometimes called the <i>floor function</i>.  Additional technical information about this concept can be found <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FloorFunction.html">here</a> (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FloorFunction.html ) and many other sites in the web.
