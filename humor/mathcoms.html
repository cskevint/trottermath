	While watching TV some years ago, I began wondering what it
would be like if there were commercials about mathematics.  So I tried
substituting the word MATH or other related words into the slogans for
well-known advertised products.  The result was the little quiz found
below.  Your job is to guess the original product name that was removed.

	For example, look at this new slogan:

<b><center><h2>MATHEMATICS.  Makin' it great!</h2></center></b>

	Of course, you recognize that this is Pizza Hut's famous phrase.
I warn you: as you try to name the products referred to in the items,
keep in mind this quiz was originally written in 1990 and 1991; so some
of the slogans may be a little unfamiliar now.

	Good luck! (Answers are below; but try not to peek too soon.)

	Well, if you're reading this, you've obviously seen the answers,
honestly or not.  So I'll give you one more slogan, of a much more
recent vintage, but no answer.  Can you get it?
