&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody knows that, in general, a telephone number consists of seven digits, right?  So if we asked a rather innocent question: <FONT FACE=ARIAL>"How long is your phone number?"</FONT>, no one would think very much was odd if the answer were <FONT FACE=ARIAL>"7 digits long"</FONT>, correct?  But what if you heard the response of <B>10.30</B> 
from one individual and <B>12.64</B> from another individual?  You knew the 
respective phone numbers were <I>278-6490</I> and <I>324-0391</I>; so what could those people be doing?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we're talking about phone numbers, let's look at the typical arrangement of the digits on the phone itself.  It should resemble something like the grid pictured below.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall how you mark, or "dial", a number on such a phone as this.  For the first example cited above, you would press the 2, then move your finger directly to the 7, then to the 8, and so on.  But as you transferred your finger from the 2 to the 7, you actually traced the <I>hypotenuse</I> of a right triangle that had legs of length 2 units and 1 unit.  Enter the <B>Pythagorean Theorem</B>: the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (legs).  In math, we would summarize that as follows:
<p><center>
(hypotenuse)<sup>2</sup> = (leg<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (leg<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>
</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So our distance from 2 to 7 would be computed in this way:
<p><center>
(hypotenuse)<sup>2</sup> = 2<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> = 4 + 1 = 5
<p>
hypotenuse   = <IMG SRC="sqrt5.gif">.
</center>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all cases need the Pythagorean Theorem, as the movement from 7 to 8 shows; it is merely the distance of <b>1</b> (unit).  The rest of our phone number works out as follows:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8 to 6 is <IMG SRC="sqrt2.gif">; 6 to 4 is <B>2</B>; 4 to 9 is <IMG SRC="sqrt5.gif">; and 9 to 0 is <IMG SRC="sqrt2.gif">.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes a grand total of
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="sqrt2_5.gif"></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using our calculator gives <B>10.30</B> (approximately).  Now you do the other 
phone number -- for homework!!!
