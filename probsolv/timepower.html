<p><blockquote><font face="comic sans ms" size=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While taking a coffee break, my secretary, Sue, happened to glance at her digital watch.  It showed the following time:
<p>
<center><table border=2 cellpadding=5 bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr><td>
1 : 4 4
</td><tr>
</table></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's rather curious," she thought.  "If I remove the two dots, I'll have the number 144, which is the square of 12.  I wonder how likely that sort of thing happens during my workday?"
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that Sue works from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m., what is the probability that her watch will show a square number?  Express your answer to the nearest hundredth of a percent.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>EXTRA:</b></i> what is the probability that a cube, 4th power, 5th power, etc. will occur in addition to squares?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><b>SUPER-EXTRA:</b></i>  what is the probability for a power of any kind appearing on a watch set to a 24-hour day?  (This means, times can range from 0:00 to 23:59.  And "first" powers are not allowed throughout this problem.)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>HYPER-EXTRA:</i></b>  if we now use the "seconds" digits that appear on many watches, what is the largest square number that can occur?  Largest cube?
