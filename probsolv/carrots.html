&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're buying carrots, and we've found two sellers who have vegetables we like. The first will sell us four pounds and six ounces for a price of two pounds seven shillings and three pence. 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second grower had a bigger crop. He asks for four pounds thirteen shillings and ten pence, and in return will give us nine pounds fourteen ounces of his carrots.
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which batch of carrots should we buy, to pay the least amount per pound? 
<p>
Solving hints you should know:
<p>
(A pound of weight is sixteen ounces. 
A pound of money in long ago England is exactly 20 shillings, and a shilling is twelve pence. 
So don't confuse the pounds of weight that measure fatness with the pounds that mark expense.)
