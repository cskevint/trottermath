<p><blockquote><font face="arial" size=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My nephew, Mitch, loves to run competitively, like cross country races, marathons, or whatever.  Recently, he competed in a special for-charity race in a small Kansas town near where he lives: the Midtown City Marathon.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this occasion, he paced himself in the following way: he ran the first 50% of the distance at his normal, preferred running speed.  Then for the next third of the distance he increased his tempo by 25%.  For the final portion of his run (3 km), he increased his previous speed by another 20%.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that he finished this marathon in the fantastic time of 1 hour, 19 minutes, state now his running speed (i.e. in kilometers per hour) for the final portion of the event.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Extra:</i> How many minutes did Mitch spend running at each of the 3 speeds?
