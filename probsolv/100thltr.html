<h2><B>INTRODUCTION</B></h2>
<p>
<font size=4>
     A popular category of puzzle-problems often involves something like the following: 
<p>
<center><I><B>What is the 1998<sup>th</sup> digit in the decimal expansion of the fraction 1/7?</B></I></center>
<p>

     Or here's another one that involves a more basic idea:
<p>
<CENTER><I><B>What is the 1000<sup>th</sup> digit of this sequence:
<p>
1234567891011121314151617... ?</B></I></CENTER>
<p>

     In another context, I have seen a problem like this one that uses letters instead of numbers:
<p>
<CENTER><I><B>What is the 100<sup>th</sup> letter in this sequence:
<p>
ABBCCCDDDD... ?</B></I></CENTER>
<p>

<B>MY PROBLEMS</B>
<p>
     I began thinking about this idea the other day and came up with a problem that I had never seen before in any book, magazine, or contest exam.  It goes like this:
<p>
<blockquote>
     <B><I>If the word names of the counting numbers are written out as "<font color="#FB3715" size=4>one, two, three, ... </font>", what letter in which number name would be the 100<sup>th</sup> letter?</I></B>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Of course, a natural companion of that problem would be this:
<p>
<blockquote>
     <B><I>If the word names of the first 100 counting numbers were written out as "<font color="#FB3715" size=4>one, two, three,..., one hundred</font>", how many letters would be written?</I></B>
</blockquote>
<p>
     Now, dear reader, don't be deceived by the apparent simplicity of these two questions.  To paraphrase a popular saying: <I>ease of solution lies in the mind of the solver</I>.  These problems were given to my 7th grade students recently [1998].  There was plenty of challenge here for these individuals, especially for the second problem.  The results were interesting; some were even correct. Many different strategies were employed.  And the important thing was that <U>all</U> would have been successful, except for a little error "here and there".
<p>
     And if you want a greater challenge, just increase the number "100<sup>th</sup>" to "1000<sup>th</sup>" or "1,000,000<sup>th</sup>" in the first problem; and likewise "one hundred" to "one thousand" or "one million" in the second problem.
<p>  
     I leave it to you to solve these letter problems.
