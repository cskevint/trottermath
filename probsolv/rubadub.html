<p><blockquote><font face="arial" size=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mother Goose City, the most elegant restaurant where the elite meet to eat is the <b>Rub-a-dub-dub Restaurant</b>.  It is owned and operated by those three wild and crazy guys: the <i>butcher</i>, the <i>baker</i>, and the <i>candlestick maker</i>.  (Perhaps you will recall, they often traveled by tub!)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they decided to become partners in this expensive project, each promised to contribute as much money as he could, according to the funds he had in his bank account.  The results can be described as follows:
<p>
<ol>
<li>the ratio of the funds contributed by the butcher and baker was 3 to 5, respectively.
<p>
<li>the amount of money contributed by the candlestick maker was equal to twice the amount of the butcher less one-half that of the baker.
<p>
<li>the total amount of money raised by the three investors was greater than 100 <b><i>mogolas</i></b> and less than 125 <b><i>mogolas</i></b>. (A <b><i>mogola</i></b> is an informal unit of money in Mother Goose Land, similar to our use of "grand" to mean $1000.)
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming that each man's contribution was an integral number of mogolas, how much money did they have to start this culinary adventure?
