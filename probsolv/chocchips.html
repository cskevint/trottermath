&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knew that Charlie had a "sweet tooth", especially for anything with chocolate in it.  So no one was very surprised to hear of his recent project.  The only surprise was the manner he conducted it.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He decided to eat one chocolate chip on the first day, then 2 chips on the second day, 3 on the 3rd day.  And so on.  Each day he ate one more than the day before.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the last day of this current month, he will have consumed a total of 1035 chips.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did Charlie start this sweet journey?

<b>Extra:</b>  On what date did Charlie reach the <i>half-way</i> point in his project?  And which chip (<i>1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup>, etc.</i>) was it that day?

<font size="-1">[Note: Since this is an "algebra" problem, it is expected that you will use normal algebra to solve it. This means that no brute force methods, such as spreadsheets or using a calculator to merely add up the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, will be accepted. There is a famous formula that you should know about that automatically finds the sum of an expression like:

We hope you can find and use it.]
