<p><blockquote><font face="comic sans ms" size=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three younger brothers, whose names are (in order by age) Gary, Corky, and Steve.  Though we have our natural differences, we do agree on one thing: we love to eat salted peanuts while watching football on TV!
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One Sunday I brought out a big bag of delicious salted, roasted peanuts to share with them.  Being the math "guru" of the family, I decided on the following unique way to portion out the peanuts.  I gave one-third of the quantity to Gary, one-fourth to Corky, and one-fifth to Steve, keeping the remaining portion for myself.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I received what was left after giving to my brothers, that does not necessarily imply that my portion was the smallest.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did my portion rank in size, from most to least (1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup>)?
<p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Extra:</i></b>  If I received between 50 and 60 peanuts as my share, how many peanuts were in the bag?
