&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of a new grading period, Ms. Zhong likes to present her pre-algebra class with extra challenging research problems.  One time she wrote the following expression on the chalk board:
<p>

<b><center><big>(A/B)^C + (D/E)^F + (G/H)^I</big></center></b>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she turned to the class and said: "In this expression you are to replace the variables with the digits from 1 to 9.  Then find its simplified value.  Your objective, however, is to substitute in such a way that the value turns out to be an <b>integer</b>, that is, a <b>whole number</b>."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her students didn't waste a moment, setting right to work with their paper, pencils, and, yes, their calculators.  In no time at all, Andrei raised his hand, and announced proudly, "I've got an answer!  I found 2283."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Very good work, Andrei," said Ms. Zhong as she examined his calculations.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then Trisha said excitedly, "And I've got one bigger than Brian's number."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After looking at her paper, Ms. Zhong smiled and said, "You certainly do.  Nice going."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From across the room, Timothy, who was often quiet and shy in math class, cautiously proclaimed, "Teacher, I think I have a smaller answer than they do."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Zhong went to his desk, patted him on his head as she grinned from ear to ear, saying, "You really do have a nice number there.  I'm proud of you all.  Now everybody continue.  It seems there are lots of different possibilities.  This certainly is a power-full problem, isn't it?"
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the week the class had found quite a long list of integral values.  How many can you find?
