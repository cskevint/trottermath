&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 2002 was not a good one for Wall Street and the investors in the stock market.  It was certainly a tough time for many people.  Then I saw this clever joke on the internet.

JUST IN TIME: SENSIBLE INVESTMENT ADVICE
<p>
If you had bought $1000.00 worth of Nortel stock one year ago, it would now
be worth $49.00.
<p>
With Enron, you would have $16.50 of the original $1,000.00.
<p>
With WorldCom, you would have less than $5.00 left.
<p>
If you had bought $1,000.00 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock)
one year ago, drank all the beer, then turned in the cans for the 10 cent
deposit, you would have $214.00.
<p>
Based on the above, our current investment advice is to drink heavily and
recycle.   </b></font>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, once my chuckles subsided, my math mind kicked in, thinking:  <i><b>Gee, I wonder if that's really true?  I mean the part about earning $214.00 recycling the beer cans.</b></i>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my teacher side took over.  <i><b>Wouldn't this make a nice middle school math problem?</b></i>  To verify the statement in the joke would require some research about the price of beer in various supermarkets or mini-marts, etc.  Then there is the matter of the deposit one would receive by turning in the empty cans.  Maybe it isn't 10 cents everywhere.  And so forth.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely it would spark a lot of discussion.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the case it wouldn't be <i>politically correct</i> to discuss alcoholic beverages in the school classroom, well, it's simple to substitute one's favorite soft drink instead.  In fact, a class could investigate different brands of colas.  Afterall, it's essentially the math that's important here, and recycling the aluminum cans, not what was inside them originally, right?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, think about it, won't you?  And report back to WTM what you discover, okay?  Thanks.
