&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximillian Smith is a modern painter of murals.  His preferred size of designs are those painted on large rectangles whose length-to-width ratio is 2-to-1.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of his recent works of art have a unique mathematical connection with his daughter, Mindy, who became a for-real teenager just last year.  You see, the numerical difference in the areas of these two paintings (as measured in square meters) is equal to Mindy's age.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the sum of the two areas?
