<h2>Preface</h2>
	This page contains some quizzes that I wrote and used in my
Pre-algebra classes (in 1996).  They were intended to examine the
mastery, or lack thereof, of "problem solving" concepts of my students,
as recently studied in class.  Each problem is based on work discussed
a few days earlier.  So as presented, the wording of some will seem a
little cryptic or confusing at first.  This was intentional, done to
see if the students were reflecting back on facts and structures covered
in the homework.  Background explanation will be provided to you in
such cases.  The inspiration for each of the items came from different
sources: the textbook, the problem solving section of the NCTM journal
<i>Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School</i>, and other places which I've
forgotten.
	A second feature that will soon become apparent as you scroll
down this page is that the quizzes come in pairs, each parallel to the
other.  This is because I had many sections of students and I needed
to have different versions (to avoid you-know-what).

<center><h3><font face="arial">Quiz: Problem Solving (A)</font></h3></center>
1.  The evil warlord, Grossout, got even meaner and nastier after you
helped the princess solve the problem last time.  So he raised his
demand.  Now she must tell him the next four squares (after your last
answer) whose digit sum is not a perfect square.  Help save the
princess again.  [See below for original.]

2.  Kendra's little cousin also collects shells, but her collection is
smaller than Kendra's.  Counting the shells by 4's or 5's leaves three
shells left.  But counting by three's leaves 2 left over as before.
How many shells are in this collection?  [See below for original.]

3.  Find at least three solutions for the alphametic when the sum is
now <u>  10,431  </u> .  [See below for original.]

4.  Use the pattern ABBCCCDDDD... .  (a) What letter is in the <u> 151st </u>
position?  (b) What position does it occupy within its own letter
group?

5.  On his birthday Jaime received $5 from his grandfather.  "Gee whiz!"
he said.  "Now I have three times as much as I would have had as if I
had spent $15 for that CD."  How much did Jaime have before receiving
the money?  [See below for original.]

1.  The evil warlord, Grossout, got even meaner and nastier after you
helped the princess solve the problem last time.  So he raised his
demand.  Now she must tell him the first perfect square larger than 999
whose digit sum is <i>not</i> a perfect square.  Help save the princess again.
[See below for original.]

2.  Kendra's little cousin also collects shells, but her collection is
smaller than Kendra's.  Counting the shells by 3's or 4's leaves only
one shell left.  But counting by five's leaves 2 left over as before.
How many shells are in this collection?  [See below for original.]

3.  Find at least three solutions for the alphametic when the sum is
now <u>  10,422  </u> .  [See below for original.]

4.  Use the pattern ABBCCCDDDD... .  (a) What letter is in the <u> 121st </u>
position?  (b) What position does it occupy within its own letter
group?

5.  On his birthday Jaime received $6 from his grandfather.  "Gee whiz!"
he said.  "Now I have three times as much as I would have had as if I
had spent $14 for that CD."  How much did Jaime have before receiving
the money?  [See below for original.]

<h3>Original problems for A/A'</h3>
<b>
1.  The evil warlord, Grossout, locked Princess Stunning in the dungeon.
Before he lets her out, she must find the first perfect square number
larger than 100 where the sum of the digits is not a perfect square.
Help the princess by finding the number.
</b>
[Menu of Problems. MTMS, March/April 1996, p. 720]
<b>
2.  Ken has between 3 and 100 shells in his collection.  If he counts
his shells 3 at a time, he has 2 left over.  If he counts them 4 at a
time, he has 2 left over.  If Ken  counts them 5 at a time, he still
has 2 left over.  How many shells does Ken have in his shell collection?
</b>
[Menu of Problems. MTMS, March/April 1996, p. 720]
<b>
3.  The alphametic referred to came from the UCSMP textbook Transition
Mathematics, p. 306.  It was "U + CAN + DO + THIS = 10440", presented
in vertical format.  As given in the text, there are quite a number
of solutions.  Then by altering the sum to other numbers one can
produce additional equivalent exercises.

5.  Karen found $2 on the sidewalk.  "Wow!" said Karen. "Now I have
five times as much as I would have had if I had lost $2!"  How much
money did Karen have before she found the $2?

<center><h3><font face="arial">Quiz: Problem Solving (B)</font></h3></center>
1.  At the 7th grade's Candy Sale at break, 4 Hershey's kisses and
7 Rice Krispy Treats cost 75 ctvs., and 7 Hershey's kisses and 4 Rice
Krispy Treats cost 90 ctvs.  How much change would I get from a ¢5
bill if I bought just 30 kisses?

2.  The Mensa toy store is having a special sale of used toys.  Everybody
is confused about the prices.  (Remember the clothing store case.)  At
this sale, a truck costs $24, a cart costs $19, and a ball costs $19.
How much would a bucket (like a child uses at the beach) cost under
the Mensa system?

3.  Susan gave Karen an amount of money equal to one-half of what Karen
had in her purse.  Then Karen gave Susan an amount equal to twice of
what Susan had left.  If now Susan has $18 and Karen has $12, what did
each girl have before this sequence of strange transactions took place?
[HINT: all numbers are whole numbers.]  Also, who made a profit in this
deal, and how much?

1.  At the 7th grade's Candy Sale at break, 5 Hershey's kisses and
6 Rice Krispy Treats cost 85 ctvs., and 6 Hershey's kisses and 5 Rice
Krispy Treats cost 80 ctvs.  How much change would I get from a ¢5
bill if I bought just 20 kisses?

2.  The Mensa toy store is having a special sale of used toys.  Everybody
is confused about the prices.  (Remember the clothing store case.)  At
this sale, a truck costs $21, a cart costs $17, and a ball costs $17.
How much would a shovel (like a child uses at the beach) cost under
the Mensa system?

3.  Susan gave Karen an amount of money equal to twice of what Karen
had in her purse.  Then Karen gave Susan an amount equal to one-half of
what Susan had left.  If now Susan has $15 and Karen has $7, what did
each girl have before this sequence of strange transactions took place?
[HINT: all numbers are whole numbers.]  Also, who made a profit in this

<h3>Original problems for B/B'</h3>
<b>
1.  If 6 pieces of licorice and 5 red-hots cost 49¢, and 6 red-hots
and 5 pieces of licorice cost 50¢, how much change will you get back
from a $1.00 bill if you buy 20 red-hots?
</b>
[The Mensa Puzzle Calendar. January 6, 1996]  Special note: in the
quiz problems I am assuming Salvadorean currency.  So "ctvo. =
centavos" and "¢ = colon".
<b>
2.  Our local clothing store is going out of business.  And no wonder.
A coat used to cost $30.00; a dress, $45.00; and socks, $45.00.  How
much would a blouse cost under this system?
</b>
[The Mensa Puzzle Calendar. February 29, 1996]  Special hint: the
solution of this problem lies in the LETTERS of the words <i>coat</i>, <i>dress</i>,
etc.; specifically the vowel-consonant concept. Is that enough help?
<b>
3.  Steve gave Keith an amount of money equal to the amount in Keith's
pocket.  Keith then gave Steve an amount equal to what Steve had left.
Keith then had $14 and Steve had $8.  How much money did Keith originally
have in his pocket?

<center><h3><font face="arial">Quiz: Problem Solving (D)</font></h3></center>
1.  Porky Pig really loves eating popcorn, but lately he's been getting
a bit "pudgy" (fat).  So his doctor put him on a peculiar diet.  Porky
could eat one piece of popcorn on the 1st day of any given month, two
pieces on the 2nd day, three on the 3rd day, and so on during the month.
The next month the whole process would begin anew.  How many pieces of
popcorn will Porky pop into his "pucker" (mouth) during the first six
months of this year?

2.  Bugs Bunny has three types of coins in his bunny-bag: nickels, dimes,
and pennies.  Thirteen of them are nickels, 3/7 of them are pennies, and
20% of them are dimes.  How much money does Bugs have in his bunny-bag?

3.  A rock-n-roll singer was so bad that one-fifth of the crowd left
after the first song.  After the 2nd song, one-half of the remaining
crowd also departed.  When the 3rd song was ended, one-third of those
people got up and "hit the road" too.  If there were now only 160
die-hard music lovers remaining, how many people paid good money for
"nuthin' much at all"?  [Work hint: there were < 1000.]

lately she's been getting a bit "pudgy" (fat).  So her doctor put her
on a peculiar diet.  Petunia could eat one piece of popcorn on the 1st
day of any given month, two pieces on the 2nd day, three on the 3rd day,
and so on during the month.  The next month the whole process would begin
anew.  How many pieces of popcorn will Petunia pop into her "pucker"
(mouth) during the six months from last November to theend of this
past April?

2.  Yosemite Sam has three types of coins in his saddlebags: nickels,
dimes, and pennies.  Eleven of them are pennies, 40% of them are dimes,
and 2/7 of them are nickels.  How much "loot" (money) is Sam "a-totin'
around in them there saddlebags"?

<h3>Original problems for D/D'</h3>
1.  As well as I can recall now, the popcorn problems were not based
on any particular practice exercise, but rather the general concept
of adding expressions like "1 + 2 + 3+ ... + n", using the famous
triangular number formula
<h3>
<center>T<sub>n</sub> = ½n(n + 1)</center>
</h3>
Click <a href="3mgame.html">here</a> for more information about triangular numbers.

2 & 3.  At the moment I can't find among my files the problems that were
the motivators for these two items.  But as they are solvable as they
stand, I will defer my search for the original sources to another day.

1.  Kermit the Frog is competing in the famous jumping contest of
Calavarass County.  He took 5 leaps, each one 1½ times as long as
the preceding one.  What was length of his first leap if his total
distance came to 422 cm? [Work hint: all jumps are whole numbers.]

2.  Fred Flintstone currently has $256 in his bank account and being
the jolly fellow he is, spends $6 from it each week at his Moose Lodge
meeting.  On the other hand, his wife, Wilma, has $136 in her kitchen's
cookie jar, and is saving $4 every week to buy herself a nice tiger
skin dress later on.  After how many weeks will they have the same
amount of money?  What will that amount of money be?  [Make a week-by-
week chart to see their respective weekly progress.]

3.  [Three Coins Revisited]  I have three kinds of coins in my pocket:
quarters, dimes, and nickels.  a) 20% of them are type "x"; b) 3/7 of
them are type "y"; and c) thirteen of them are of type "z".  If the
total value of my money is <u> $8.40 </u>, how many coins of each kind do I
have?

<h3>Original problems for E/E'</h3>
1 & 3.  The same is true for this pair of problems.  So again I will
just let sleeping dogs lie and not get too disturbed about my references
until a more serendipitous opportunity arises.  Check back at a later
time if you're curious. Sorry.

2.  This one was based on a problem in an old MATHCOUNTS handbook.  I
even used the concept with some classes of 4th grade students prior to
1996, employing the names of John and Mary.  Go to <a href="updown.html">Up-down Match Game</a>
to see how this was done.
