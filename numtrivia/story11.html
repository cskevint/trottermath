<div align="left">On June 18, 2001 I sent this email to the <a href="http://www.47.net/47society/">47 Society</a>:</div><br>
<blockquote>
<div align="left">Perhaps you are familiar with the reverse-the-digits-&-add activity to achieve palindromes.  Well, let's take our beloved and often mystical "47" and see what happens.</div><br>

<img src="121.gif" align="right"><div align="left">47 + 74 = 121   Wow!  How lucky can we get?  A palindrome on our first try. </div><br> 

<div align="left">And not just any old palindrome either.  For starters, it's the smallest palindromic square.  Its square root (11) is the smallest non-trivial palindrome of all!  [IMHO, the digits 0 - 9 are not terribly interesting as palindromes go.]</div><br>

<div align="left">And 11 = 4 + 7 to bring us full circle back to 47.</div><br>

<div align="left">Finally, if we continue with 121 to reverse-and-add, we get</div><br>

<div align="left">121 + 121 = 242   and   242 + 242 = 484.  (484 = 22<sup>2</sup>)</div><br>

<div align="left">So 47 is the "parent" of three consecutive palindromes, two of which are squares.</div><br>

<div align="left">3 cheers for 47!</div><br>

<div align="left">     However, <b>47</b> isn't alone in this power.  You see, <b>29</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>56</b>, and their reversals behave in the same way, regarding the palindromic reverse-&-add procedure.  So there's no real point repeating that work for these integers.</div><br>

<div align="left">     So let's attack the matter from a different aspect: <i><b>prime factorization</b></i>!  Here are the prime factorizations of all eight integers.</div><br>

<center><table border=0>
<tr><td>
<ul>
<li><b>29 - prime</b>
<li>92 = 2 x 2 x 23<br><br>

<li>38 = 2 x 19
<li></li><b>83 - prime</b><br><br>

<li><b>47 - prime</b>
<li></li>74 = 2 x 37<br><br>

<li>56 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
<li>65 = 5 x 13</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<div align="left">     Of the four pairs, three of them contain one prime each.</div><br>

<div align="left">     The sum of the digits in the factorizations in the "prime-less" pair is the same: 
<b><big>2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 5 + 1 + 3 = 9</big></b>.</div><br>

<div align="left">     The prime factorizations of <b>92</b> and <b>56</b> exhibit a striking similarity: they each contain three 2's and one 3.</div><br>

<div align="left">     Three of the remaining composite numbers have prime factorizations that consist of three distinct digits.  Let's examine them a little more in detail now, in fact, in their counting order <b>38</b>, <b>65</b>, and <b>74</b>.  In order to do that, we will form the other 5 permutations of the digits.</div><br>

<div align="left">     The digits used in the prime factorization of <b>38</b>, namely 2, 1, and 9, are arranged in the only possible way for a proper factorization.</div>

<ul>
<li>1 x 29 is invalid as 1 is not prime.
<li>1 x 92 is invalid as neither number is a prime.
<li>2 x 91 is invalid because 91 is not a prime.
<li>9 x 12 is invalid as neither is prime.
<li>9 x 21 is invalid as neither is prime.</ul>

     The digits used in the factorization of <b>65</b> {1, 3, 5} consist of the first three odd integers.  They yield these other factorizations, only <b>one</b> of which is valid.

<ul>
<li>1 x 35 is invalid as neither is prime.
<li>1 x 53 is invalid as 1 is not prime.
<li>3 x 15 is invalid as 15 is not prime.
<li>3 x 51 is invalid as 51 is not prime.
<li><b><font color=#FF0000">5 x 31 is valid.</font></b>
</ul>

<div align="left">     The digits used in the factorization of <b>74</b> {2, 3, 7} are all primes themselves.  And they give us <b>two</b> more proper factorizations: </div><br>

<ul>
<li><b><font color=#FF0000">2 x 73 is valid.</font></b>
<li>3 x 27 is invalid as 27 is not prime
<li>3 x 72 is invalid as 72 is not prime
<li><b><font color=#FF0000">7 x 23 is valid.</font></b>
<li>7 x 32 is invalid as 32 is not prime.</ul>

     The number 56 has the unique distinction among all eight values above in that when it is multiplied by 11, a palindrome results: <font color=#FF0000">616</font>.

     There are 143 three-digit primes, and exactly 47 of them have the property that the sum of the squares of their digits (SSD) is also a prime.  The <font color="ff0000">11</font>th prime in this list of 47 primes is 3<font color="ff0000">11</font> [note the "<font color="ff0000">11</font>" there] and the SSD is likewise <font color="ff0000">11</font>, because
<p>
<center>3<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> = 9 + 1 + 1 = <font color="ff0000">11</font>.</font></center>

     We found this item on the website <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/curios/">Prime Curios</a>...
<p>
     <font color="ff0000">11311---  The smallest number that is the sum of twice a positive square and a prime in 53 ways. Note it's also a palindromic prime.</font>
<p>
     We liked the appearance of "11" on either side of the "3"!  Now let's all try to find some of those squares and primes referred to in the comment.
<p>
     Also, here is something nice that we've adapted from an item (for <a href="http://primes.utm.edu/~caldwell/curios/page.php/643.html">643</a>) on the Prime Curio website regarding 3 and 8, whose sum is 11...
<p>
<center><font size=4 color="0000ff">3<sup>8</sup> + 8<sup>3</sup> is divisible by 11.</font></center>
<p>
     That intrigued us enough to check out the other "addition facts" for 11.  Here are the results.
<p>
<center><font size=4 color="0000ff">1<sup>10</sup> + 10<sup>1</sup> = 11.</font></center>
<p>
<center><font size=4 color="0000ff">2<sup>9</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 593.</font></center>
<p>
<center><font size=4 color="0000ff">4<sup>7</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> = 18785.</font></center>
<p>
<center><font size=4 color="0000ff">5<sup>6</sup> + 6<sup>5</sup> = 23401.</font></center>
<p>
     The first result is 11 directly.  The 2nd result is a prime.  The 3rd result has a prime factorization of 5 x 13 x 17<sup>2</sup>.  And the last one consists of five consecutive digits.
