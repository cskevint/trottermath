I'll try to tell you now what led me to decide to come to El Salvador ...
<p>
<ol>
<li>As I said earlier, I was born in Kansas (1941).
<p>
<li>In 1955 I got polio, leaving me severely disabled in all 4 limbs,
but not my mind (I think).  I get around in an electric wheelchair.
<p>
<li>I graduated from <a href="http://www.sckans.edu/"> Southwestern College</a>, a small 4-yr college in south-central Kansas in
1965, & began teaching h.s. math & social studies in small towns,
while living with my father & step-mother, he a school administrator,
she a teacher.
<p>
<li>In those latter years & up to 1971, my 2 younger brothers had
left home to seek their fortunes, as the story says.  And my
step-mother divorced my father, leaving him to take care of me.
<p>
<li>Since my dad wasn't in the greatest of health in those times, I
felt I had to look for a way to "seek my fortune" as well,
independent of him, a much more difficult task, as I'm sure you can
imagine.  So being an NCTM member, one day in Nov 1970, I received a
brochure from the math dept of the <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu/index.html">U. of Illinois</a>, describing an
Academic Year Institute, sponsored by NSF.  It offered a money
stipend + benefits, etc.  and you had to be teaching currently in
order to apply, which I was.  And I had recently learned thru a
contact that the UI was a good place for people in wheelchairs - 
rehab services, buses, the works.
<p>
<li>So I applied!  And was denied.  Well, not exactly.  As I had
filled out the places on the form about being handicapped, the
director told me that if (a) the rehab services office would approve
me, & (b) I could foot my own bill, then I could join the others.
<p>
<li>Without going into all the details, those hurdles were met.  A
friend & ex-student said he'd go with me & take care of my physical
needs.  And after I got there on campus, the director (Dr Zaring)
told me that they could grant me a tuition waiver, to help cut my
expenses.  Whew!  So I got my master's degree by the following summer
('72).
<p>
<li>Well, life was so nice there for a person in my condition.  Tho
my friend left me, I could find students to trade care for room &
board (I lived in married student housing - mini-apartments - on
campus).  So I decided to transfer to the College of Education & go for a
doctorate in math ed.
<p>
<li>Suffice it to say, I'm an ABD now.  But that's another tale.
<p>
<li>From Sept '77 to May '80, I worked in an all-black k-8 school
district in the suburbs south of Chicago.  Work went well, no
troubles in that regard.  But managing to find a person(s) to look
after my care was getting hard.  It wasn't always great down at UI in
Urbana-Champaign, but really tough up there.
<p>
<li>In the fall of '79, 3 forces in my life fused together into one
plan.  (a) Ever since my childhood back in Kansas, I had wanted to
learn Spanish, & either visit or live in a Spanish-speaking country. 
I had picked up a little knowledge in a h.s. course, among other
ways.  (b) After graduating from college in '65, I naturally was
thinking about marriage.  But who would want me?  In a wheel chair, etc.  (My
parents never let me even entertain the thought, much less have
girlfriends -- something hard to come by in small town Kansas, at my
age.)  (c) In 1973 I met the <a href="http://www.bahai.org/">Bah�'� Faith</a> at the university, &
decided that it was good, & good for me.  So I became a Bah�'�.  One
of the features in this religion is called "pioneering", going to another
country, to teach others about it.  But unlike a normal church
missionary, a Bah�'� pioneer is not salary-supported by a home-based
organization.  Rather he/she must find his/her own means of support in
his/her adopted home.
<p>
<li>I saw an article that fall in a Bah�'� publication about a young
follower who was then pioneering in Mexico, teaching ESL (English as a Second Language).  By that
time I had gotten interested in ESL, bilingual ed, etc.; taken a
couple of Spanish courses at UIUC; not making matrimonial progress;
and getting frustrated with my personal situation.  So I wrote that
guy.  He answered right back, saying "Come on down.  The English institute
where I work is a small family business who wants North Americans to
spend a year teaching.  In return they offer room & board, + a small
salary for personal items."  Well, I decided to put my trust in God &
go!  What did I have to lose?  I had suffered too many freezing
Chicago winters -- not good on a wheel chair or my weak arms.  And what the
heck -- I might even find a wife, some Spanish-speaking young woman
willing to marry a U.S. citizen.  (ha.)
<p>
<li>With the help of a couple of good friends, I loaded my van with
all my worldly goods & headed south, June 1980.  Destination:
Tapachula, Mexico.  The extreme southern tip.  In mid-October, a
young Salvadorean woman, Gloria, arrived with 3 of her siblings & a
9-yr-old daughter, refugees escaping from troubles here in El Salvador.  She
became the cook at the institute.  And as they say, one thing led to
another.  We got engaged in December, & married June 28, 1981 -- the
first Bah�'� wedding ceremony performed in that region.
<p>
<li>Earlier that spring, thru contacts with a Bah�'� couple who was
already working at the <a href="http://www.amschool.edu.sv/">Escuela Americana</a> in San Salvador, I landed a job teaching math, grades 7-9.  And not a minute too soon.  My year was almost up at the
institute, I couldn't find a job in Mexico, & it turned out that my
wife had a girl & a boy older than the daughter I met first.  Instant
family!  (You know what I mean...)
<p>
<li>July 1981 Gloria, her 2 daughters (she returned once to bring the
other daughter out), her brother, her sister, her sister's fianc�e
(driving) & I all piled in my van & came to E.S. to start a new life.
