<h3>Preface</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This page in WTM is a very unique one.  It was written by a
young lady with an extraordinary talent and interest in math.  After
you read it, I'm sure you'll agree with me.

<b><font size=5>Hypatia of Alexandria</font></b>
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to introduce Hypatia, the daughter of Theon, a
mathematician and the last 'head' of the important learning institution,
the Museum of Alexandria.  Hypatia was known for her striking beauty and
her mastery of rhetoric, or giving speeches.  Many important people came
to listen to her, not just on mathematics, or astronomy, but also for her
explanations of the philosophy taught by Plato and Plotinus. Her dad had
supervised all her early education, but with her greater intelligence,
she soon surpassed him, becoming the world's greatest mathematician and
philosopher of her time.  She chose to dedicate her life to learning, and
chose not to marry.  Anyway, with her extraordinary dignity and virtue
many men still fell under her spell and at least one of her students was
goofy enough to admit his love for her.  She resorted to a very gross,
and harsh lesson to make him stop making romantic advances towards her.
(<i>Just another example where girls rule and boys drool</i>.) 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is some uncertainty in how long Hypatia lived, some
historians think she was born in 370 AD, but more now believe it was
around 355 AD.  Then most think she died in 415, but there is some
evidence that it was 416 AD.  Even though there were several women in
mathematics before Hypatia, she is considered the first significant one,
because she was the associated with the most important learning
institution in the Roman Empire, the Museum of Alexandria.  She lived
at a time when being an educated woman, a mathematician or a neoplatonist
was dangerous, and because she was devoted at all times to magic
astrolabes and instruments of music, the Christians labeled her as a
pagan and evil.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypatia wrote a commentary on the writings of Diophantus, called
Arithmetica, she wrote an explanation of the ideas of conic sections
introduced by Apollonius, and with her father helped comment on the book
on geometry, called Euclid's Elements.  Sadly none of the books she wrote
survived, so most of what is known about her come from letters written by
one of her famous students, Synesius of Cyrene, to Hypatia and other
prominent men.  (Synesius helped formulate the Christian doctrine of the
Trinity, using neoplatonist principles learned from Hypatia.)  His letters
show profound admiration for her brilliance and creative scientific ability.
(I think he probably was in love with her, too.)  In Hypatias time the
mathematicians and astronomers wrote books of tables of star charts to
predict eclipses and the position of the planets. This was real math, but
because many of the unschooled Christians did not understand simple math,
they thought predicting an eclipse was magic.  There was another group of
people, at this time that tried to use numerology to predict their own
future, and because both mathematicians and charlatans used math the
Christians wanted to eliminate both from Alexandria. 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 30 years, while Archbishop Theophilus, and her friend,
Synesius were alive Hypatia was not harassed by the Christians. When
Cyril inherited his Uncle Theophiluss position and power, in 412 AD,
and then when Synesius himself died in 413 AD she was suddenly left
without her powerful protectors. 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypatia continued to give many speeches and a lot of the
Alexandrian men, and magistrates from great distances came and listened,
including the prefect Orestes, governor of Alexandria. Cyril, the Bishop
of Alexandria, felt threatened by so many people thinking Hypatias views
on freedom of thought might be good, and because the church could lose
control over the people and their money.  Cyril sent some of his 500
private Christian militia after Orestes, but he escaped, but then
Orestess army caught Peter, one of leaders of Cyrils men, and tortured
him until he died.  Cyril knew that as long as Orestes was listening to
Hypatia he wouldn't have control over him and the civil government of
Alexandria.  Cyril then set about stirring up fear in the people by
saying Hypatia was evil, and that only he and the church could guarantee
a good life after death.  From what I have read I don't think it is really
known which group of Christian fanatics murdered her, but in the end
Hypatia was kidnapped from her carriage, as she was returning home.  They 
dragged her to a church, the Caesarium, today known as St. Michael's, 
stripped her clothes off, brutally killed her, dismembered her body, and
then burned them. (<i>YUCK, this sounds like our current nightly news</i>.)
Anyway, some say, after Orestres heard of her death he resigned his
position, and fled the city. Soon after Hypatias death, the few
remaining scholars fled the city, too, and Alexandria stopped being
the center of learning and knowledge.  Cyril's most vigorous defender,
the Coptic bishop John of Nikiu wrote: "[After Hypatia's death] all the
people surrounded the patriarch Cyril and named him 'the new Theophilus';
for he had destroyed the last remains of idolatry in the city."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is just a little bit of extra information on something I 
thought was horrible, that some historians think happened around Hypatia's 
life time. It might not be really true, but if I think about it for more 
than a millisecond will make my eyes water.
Theophilus who, before he died, of course (duh), when he had his army of 
Christians destroy the pagan temple of Seraphis, they accidentally destroyed
part of the building that housed the library of 500,000 papyrus scrolls.
Some historians also think what Cyril, after Hypatias death, to keep the
Christian people in ignorance of other people's point of view, intentionally had his army destroy the last large library in Alexandria of 200,000
historical papyrus scrolls. I think that is very sad, and if this really
did happen, I don't think this turkey Cyril should be a Saint!

and for trying to give me suggestions to keep my report historically
correct. --- Lisa :>)]
