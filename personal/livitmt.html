<h3>Tournament News & Notices:</h3>
Date: Jan. 20, 2004
<p>
To: Indiagonal Jones, King Michael, Malcolm, spocko, truckman, & bdk1
<p>
From: jestone
<p>
Hey guys!  Here is my proposal to you all for a friendly tournament of loop chess.  But first, let me introduce you past IYT players to "bdk1".  bdk1, a.k.a. "mike", is an old friend of mine from England who I met long ago, before I found IYT or brainking.  He has agreed to join us.  That way, we will have 7 players in our event, assuming you all agree to my plan described below.  And also, "truckman" is a personal, "live" friend who I've known for many years here in my home.  He's good too.
<p>
Here's what I now have in mind:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Due to troubles in being in more than one brainking event at a time, we will play the games in the brainking server, but organize our tournament structure here in my website, as we have done before.  (See <a href="cf4tmt.html">cf4tmt</a>, <a href="ck1tmt.html">ck1tmt</a>, & <a href="egtmt.html">egtmt</a>.)
<p>
<li>To make it easier for me to keep track of things, I'd prefer that we play only 1 game per opponent.  I've done it both ways, & believe me, 1 is easier than 2.
<p>
<li>Since we'll have 7 players, this means each of us will play 6 games.  Three games will be with white, three with black.  Color assignments will be made using the standard charts used by the USCF and other such organizations.  Players are placed in a list from 1 to 7, based on current ratings in brainking.  Simply stated, if the rank of 2 players are either even-odd, or odd-even, the higher ranked player gets white.  If the ranks are both even, or both odd, then the lower ranked player gets white.  (Really, it is simple.  See list below.)
<p>
<li>The player with white is primarily responsible for sending the invitation, though either person may do so.
<p>
<li>As to time limit for moves, I'd like to set my personal games at 9 days/move.  That's to protect me in case of sickness or unforeseen troubles.  However, those who know me, as you all do, know that I tend to move at a regular, much faster pace.  So, perhaps each of you could decide what is appropriate for you.  Also, set all games for public view and subject to being rated by brainking's system.
<p>
<li>As each game is finished, I would like for each player to drop me a note, telling me what happened.  You can do this by brainking's message service or by dropping me an email.  However, I will, as time & opportunity permits, go to your profile and see how things are going as well.  I will then record the results in the cross-table below.
<p>
<li>I feel that we could make the official start for Wednesday, January 21, 2004.
<p>
<li>If there is anything I've forgotten to mention above, just ask me.
</ol>

"truckman" is Pablo Ayala, aged 32 or so.  I've known him for many years, virtually as a member of my family.  I've played a lot of chess with him, as has my son.  Believe me, he's a worthy opponent, & I'm glad he can join us.

<h3>malcolm, aka Black Knight</h3>
Here's the story:
<p>
<blockquote>
Hello, my name is Malcolm and I am 52.  I have worked as a Senior Biomedical Scientist in Laboratory Medicine at a very busy hospital in the centre of UK for about 33 years.  I have a lovely wife and three children.
<p>
My hobbies include chess in all forms and variations, problem solving, digital photography, web site publishing, crown green bowling and dancing. 
<p>
My nickname on IYT is <b>Black Knight</b>, which has nothing to do with the evil one.  I am suffering from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which is the name given to a group of disorders of the Retina, all of which result in a progressive reduction in vision. The Retina is the light sensitive tissue inside the eye in which the first stages of seeing take place. In RP disorders, various parts of the Retina cease to function. The symptoms of this group of disorders usually become apparent between the ages of 10 and 30, although some changes may become apparent in childhood. By contrast, some types of RP may only show symptoms late in life. In the more common types of RP, a person will have a history of visual problems at dusk or in poor light, so-called night blindness and a gradual reduction in the field of vision, loss of the outer edges, resulting in a tendency to trip over things. That is, everything is black at night, hence <b>Black Knight</b>.  I have only 15% vision although my central vision is near perfect.  I can see enough to continue working and, of course, to "play" on my computer.
<p>
I am very glad to be giving the opportunity to play in these tournaments and to hopefully be a champion one of these days.  Beware Blind-Fury, Spocko, Tony and others, <b>Black Knight</b> is about!

<h3>Indiagonal Jones, aka Martin L.</h3>
<blockquote>
Hi! My name is Martin Landry ("Peter Pawn" on IYT or "Indiagonal Jones" on "Brainking.com" or many others). I'm 44 years old and have 3 children, 2 girls, 1 little boy separated. I've studied Ancient History, Anthropology and Archeology at the University of Montreal some many years ago, so what attracts me for the game of chess, is not only the game itself but all the "stuff" around and the history of it for sure I live in Quebec, Canada, so my natural language is French by the way. 
<p>
I think the game of chess is something like a kind of "Art" while at the same time has an aspect of "scientific".  I learned chess when I was a child from my father who told me how to play the game.  Since then I have been fascinated by it, but I took it seriously only in my College years doing some competition in Quebec at the time Afterwards, with a family, I had to refrain my desire to compete, so more recently I've turned to chess on the internet which gave me some kind of same opportunities and more time maybe However, as "virtual chess" is not the same as the "real thing", I often go to a little chess café at Montreal to play with some friends of mine time to time 
<p>
Beside the game of chess in itself, I like to play some variations of it, like King's Corner or King's Fortress (seems to be my speciality so far on IYT!) just to see how it works and how it can be interesting so far from the real chess game. At last, may I say we should all applaud our friend, Terry, who keeps records, crosstable and the organization with Tony for the tournament Thanks, Terry!
