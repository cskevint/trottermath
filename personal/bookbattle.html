<p><blockquote><font face="arial" size=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew the Assured, Brian the Big, Casey the Careful, Dootles the Dreamy and Edwina the Eager are all members of a reading club, 'The Burping Bookworms'. They have a bizarre rule in the club: for each 5-person group, they must read 5 books in week, but in a special way--after they finish reading each book they must exchange them within the group, so that after several switches, each of them could finish reading the same 5 books at the same time. (Suppose they could all read at the same speed and swap books at the same time.)
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a pleasurable week of switching-and-reading, Casey the Careful was chatting with her friend, '3M', Mazy the Mathematics Maniac.
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Casey piped up, 'You're a math frenzy, Mazy, and you know about our 'Burping Bookworms' reading club, so I'll give you a puzzle to solve.'
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casey took out a sheet of paper on which she jotted down facts:
<p><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The last book Andrew read was the second book Brian read;
<li>The last book Casey read was the fourth book Brian read;
<li>The second book Casey read was handed to her by Andrew;
<li>The last book Dootles read was the third book Casey read;
<li>The fourth book Brian read was the third book Edwina read;
<li>The third book Dootles read was the book Casey had borrowed from the library (and read) in the first place.
</ol> </blockquote>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Could you figure out the sequence in which we read these 5 books?' 
 <p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as a matter fact, Mazy was a real math maniac, and in a short time she was proudly handing her work over to Casey. Can you?
