<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As should be well known by now, my chosen career was that of a school teacher, mostly in the field of mathematics.  I have worked at a wide variety of levels, ranging from elementary students up to university courses.  For the most part, however, I taught at the middle school and high school levels - grades 6 through 12.  But math wasn't the only thing.  I enjoyed several years of teaching English to non-native speakers, or ESL as it is called in the teaching world.  That acronym stands for English as a Second Language.  It was as a teacher of ESL that I came to Tapachula and met my Gloria.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came by this profession naturally.  My father was a school teacher, sports coach, principal, and superintendent for many years.  My mother and two of my three step-mothers were teachers as well.  You might say, teaching runs in my blood.  I'd like think it runs through my very soul, but that may be going too far.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was therefore quite logical and natural for me to become involved in the education of Gloria's daughters.  First, it was Areli.  I began trying to give her simple classes in English and math during my free time around the institute, of which I had plenty.  Our conversations were definitely good practice for my Spanish, not to mention good for father-daughter bonding activities.  Rather soon, Anne suggested something that raised the bar considerably.  Nearby the institute was a private <i>colegio</i> [school] that had children of many ages.  Why not enroll Areli there?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was called Instituto de Soconusco.  The owner was a lady known as Stra. Lopez.  When I talked with her one day, things seemed to be possible until it came to the matter of tuition.  Gloria and I were not capable of managing that.  So I offered this idea.  What if I would come over once or twice a week to give English classes in exchange for the tuition?  That was agreeable to her, and it was set.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, when Sonia came, the situation was different.  Gloria had to whisk her out of San Salvador in a great hurry.  She was not able to bring along any official papers, such as a birth certificate, let alone a passport.  Areli did have them, so enrollment in a school was legal.  But for Sonia, nothing of the sort was in our hands. However, I didn't need any red-tape forms to teach her.  I simply bought a good book for learning English and we began our own daily educational activity.  I even threw in some math at times.  The important thing was that my soon-to-be daughters were getting educated, and that's what counts the most.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little did I know that there was another surprise just around the corner.  By now, Gloria had observed me taking a great interest in the well-being of the girls and the whole family as well.  One morning while we were in the back of the institute, in the open-air laundry area, she said to me, "Terry, I have something I want to tell you.  It's that I have another child, a son, older than Sonia.  He's still down there in San Salvador."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said these words perhaps half-way expecting this to harm our relationship.  That I would turn away from her.  After all, it was her belief that no man would be willing to accept a woman who already had so many children by a prior relationship.  Such is the <i>macho</i> philosophy in the Latino culture.  On the other hand, perhaps she was beginning to see a different sort of male figure in me, due to my accepting behavior so far, thus was willing to take a chance on confessing to me.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, only she knows the feelings that flowed through her being when, without any hesitation, I replied, "<i>Qué bueno!  Tres es mi número favorito!</i> " [How nice!  Three is my favorite number!]

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, mind you. This was not just some platitude, meant to play up to this young woman, determined to look after her children, so that I could continue with our own  romantic relationship.. It had a definite foundation in my own past history.  My father's third wife - my second step-mother, Donna - accepted three boys (ages 14, 11, and 8) when she married him.  I told Gloria, that if she could step up and take on the responsibility of raising three boys that were not biologically hers, surely I could do the same.  As well might be imagined, these words brought a great relief to Gloria.  She now could feel more tranquil about continuing with me.  Her children would be accepted and loved by this American <i>gringo</i>.  She now knew she had nothing to lose and everything to gain.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times since that fateful day, I said a little prayer, "God, thank you for Donna."
