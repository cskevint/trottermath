�����The second half of a famous "Mother Goose" nursery rhyme goes something like this:
<p>
<center><table width=50% border=0>
<tr><td><font face="comic sans ms">
The King was in the counting-house,<br>
Counting out his money,<br>
The Queen was in the parlour,<br>
Eating bread and honey,<br><br>

The maid was in the garden,<br>
Hanging out the clothes,<br>
When down came a little bird<br>
And snapped off her nose!<br></font>
</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
�����Now, I have no particular interest in the affairs of those two ladies.  As the king's Royal Mathematician, however, I do have a curiosity about how much money he was counting.
<p>
�����So I went to His Highness to inquire.
<p>
�����His reply to my question as to how many gold coins he had on His counting table was rather unexpected.  He said:
<p>
<img src="coinstack1.gif" align="left" width=175>�����"If I put all my coins in stacks of 25 each, I have 15 coins left over in another, shorter stack.  If I then put them in stacks of 35 each, I still have 15 left over, just as before.  But if I put them in stacks of 45, there are no coins left over.  It comes out just right!"
<p>
�����Well, my friends, I'm not called the Royal Mathematician for nothing.  I took out my quill, ink bottle and a piece of parchment, and set to work.  In no time at all, I knew just how many gold coins the King had.
<p>
�����To answer this problem, tell me the number of stacks of coins the King
had in His first counting method.
<p>
�����Remember: define your variables carefully, set up good equations, and use algebraic thinking.  (And remember; there were no calculators nor computers in the King's time!)
<p>
�����<b>BONUS:</b>  How does the first half of this famous rhyme go?</font>
