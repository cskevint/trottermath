&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank and Fat Freddy are real good friends.  They like to pass time together playing on their favorite apparatus in the park, the see-saw (a.k.a. the teeter-totter).  They especially enjoy showing off their math talents to their friends and families by calculating how far from the <i>fulcrum</i> each needed to sit in order to balance the board horizontally.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day Frank said, "I weigh 90 pounds, and my buddy weighs an additional 4/9 of my weight."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Fat Freddy, who obviously has made too many trips to his local fast food restaurant, said, "If I sit 27 decimeters from the fulcrum, I can tell Frank just where he should sit on his side so that we will be evenly balanced."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is that distance?
