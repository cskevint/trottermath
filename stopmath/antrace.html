&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two ants, whose names are Ant M and Ant B, often compete with each other to see who can be the first to grab a sweet morsel of food.  Ant B, the faster runner of the two, always runs at twice the speed of Ant M.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day they both saw a particularly inviting crumb of bread that was 100 cm directly to the east of Ant M.  At that moment Ant B happened to be some distance straight north of Ant M's position.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the signal "1, 2, 3, GO!", they both ran to the crumb of bread, arriving at the same moment.  A tie!  So they decided to share it.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your task for this problem is to determine just how far north of Ant M was Ant B at the start of this little race.
