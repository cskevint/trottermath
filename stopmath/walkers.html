<p><blockquote><font face="" size=>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tri-cities Walkers is an athletic club whose members come from the neighboring cities of Allendy, Benton, and Carver.  Each year they sponsor a unique fund-raising event to support various social, recreational, and health service causes in their area.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their walk-a-thon works like this.
<p>
<ol>
<li>One spring weekend the club members from a certain city, say Allendy, enlist the aid of interested persons to join them to walk to Benton.  Upon completing the trek, a "score" is obtained by multiplying the number of participants by the miles between the cities.
<p>
<li>The following weekend the members of Benton must match that score as they walk to Carver.  However, as the distance is different, they need to enlist a different number of people.
<p>
<li>Finally, the third weekend the members of Carver, who now walk to Allendy (to complete the cycle), must likewise match the score.  Again a different distance implies a change in the number of people.
</ol>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So here's what happened for the most recent event.  After the first leg of the walk was completed (Allendy to Benton), the "score" was announced.  As the distance between Benton and Carver was 1 mile shorter, the Benton members enlisted 50 more participants.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the final Carver-to-Allendy leg, the distance was 4 miles greater than for the first leg.  Hence, there was a need for 100 fewer persons this time.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the "score" figure for the event described here?
