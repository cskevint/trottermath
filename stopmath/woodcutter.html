&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wallace Brown (<i>a.k.a.</i> Woodcutter Wally) works at Lloyds' Lumberyard.  His main job is to cut long boards into shorter pieces, according to the needs of the customers.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>He needs your help, however, on his latest task, as solving math problems is not his strongest talent.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A customer brings in some boards, all 4.6 m in length and requests to have them cut into 2 sizes - 40 cm and 70 cm.  The number of the 70-cm pieces should be twice that of the 40-cm pieces. 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, there's a catch: no wood must be wasted.  All the lumber must be used in the final result.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does Wally accomplish this?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, one more fact is necessary.  The customer has brought in between 25 and 30 boards.
<p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Extra:</b>  Why is it necessary to state the fact about 25-30 boards, so that this problem can have a unique answer?
