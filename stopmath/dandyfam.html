<p><blockquote><font face="comic sans ms" size=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Handel Dandy - known as Handy to his friends - married Mandeline - known as Mandy to her friends - they decided to name their 2 children with rhyming words as well.  That explains the cases of their son, Sandy (really named Sander) and their younger daughter, Candy (really named Candice).
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, when I went to visit them at their home, talk got around to their ages.  Handy told me, "The sum of my age and Mandy's age is 75."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, that's true," said his wife.  "And the sum of my age and Sandy's age is 52."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy chimed in with this comment, "And the sum of the ages for me and my little sister is 27."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Candy really brought the conversation to an interesting point when she announced proudly, "Now you can easily find the sum of the ages of me and my daddy."
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took out a piece of paper and a pencil, and soon arrived at the sum Candy referred to.  What was it?
<p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Extra:</b>  if the difference in ages of the parents were 3 years (which isn't true, by the way), how old would Handy have been when Candy was born?
<p>
Or...
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Extra:</b>  What are the possible ages that Handy might have been when Candy was born. (Assume all ages are expressed as positive integers.)
