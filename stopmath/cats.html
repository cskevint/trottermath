<img src="catblack2.gif" align="left">My neighbor, George, owns seven cats.  The three oldest cats (Liberty, Lucky and Alexander) are 100% black and the only outdoor cats in the group. The sum of their weights equals the sum of the weights of the four indoor cats (Sassy, Moonlight, Bubba and Randy).
<p>
Alexander weighs 2 oz. more than Lucky, who in turn weighs 6 oz. more than Liberty.
<p>
Randy, in turn, weighs 6 oz. more than Moonlight and 9 oz. more than Sassy. In addition Bubba weighs 28 oz. less than twice Randy's weight.
<p>

<p> 
Lucky and Randy are almost the same weight, but Lucky is the heavier of the two.
<p>
If their weights are all integers, what is the least that the cats could weigh?
<p> 
Bonus:  How many pounds do the 7 cats weigh in all?

<b>Here is a variant on the story as given above.  It has different answers...</b>
<p>
<img src="kitns4.gif" align="left">My neighbor, George, owns seven kittens.  The three oldest kittens are Liberty, Lucky and Alexander. The sum of their weights equals the sum of the weights of the four younger kittens (Sassy, Moonlight, Bubba and Randy).
<p>
<img src="kitns3.gif" align="right">Alexander weighs 2 oz. more than Lucky, who in turn weighs 6 oz. more than Liberty.
<p>
<i>Bubba weighs 12 oz. more than Randy, who is 3 oz. more than Moonlight and 13 oz. more than Sassy.
<p>
Lucky and Bubba are almost the same weight, but Lucky is the heavier of the two.</i>
<p>
What is the least that each kitten could weigh and still meet all of the given requirements?
