<div align="left">�����Tom, Dick, and Harry are best friends.  They do everything together, and share the good times and the bad times equally.  Just like the Three Musketeers, their motto is: <b>one for all and all for one</b>.</div><br>
<div align="left">�����Lately, Tom and Dick are doing okay, economically.  Tom has been working as a bank teller for about a year and Dick has a good job at the local House of Pizza.  Only Harry is down on his luck these days, having been laid off from his job at Doorway Computers.</div><br>
<img src="pizzaeatboy2.gif" align="right"><div align="left">�����One evening they decide to eat a pizza at the HOP where Dick works.  They can take advantage of his employee discount, you see.</div><br>
<div align="left">�����Harry said, "Well, fellows, I can chip in with $2.40 anyway."</div><br>
<div align="left">�����Dick said, "Great.  And I can easily afford to pay my <i>fair share</i>."</div><br>
<div align="left">�����Tom said, "No problem, guys.  I'll kick in with the remaining 40% of the cost of it."</div><br>
<img src="pizzapie.gif" align="left"><div align="left">�����If the above facts involve the cost of the pizza only, and not the soft drinks, how much does the pizza cost?</div><br>
<div align="left">�����<b>Bonus:</b>  If Dick's employee discount is 20%, what would you and I have to pay for the same pizza?</div><br></font>
