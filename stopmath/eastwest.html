<p><blockquote><font face="comic sans ms" size=4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny West and his best friend, Ernesto, are participating in a walk-a-thon event, to raise funds for a charity in their home town.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organizers decide to try something new and different.  The participants are to be divided into 2 groups that will walk in <i>opposite</i> directions, one toward the east, the other toward the west.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 9:05 a.m. Ernesto's group started out, going east.  He was walking at a speed of 220 yd per minute.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at 9:15, Johnny's group began walking westward, of course.  But he was walking at a pace that was 10% faster than his friend.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what time, to the nearest minute, will the two friends be 15 miles apart?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Extra:</b>  The boys walked different distances.  Who walked farther?  What was the difference?
