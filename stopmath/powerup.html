&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professor Lazanu is a world-class expert on exponents.  He often enjoys showing his three precocious young nieces interesting and curious number facts and relationships based on the idea of bases and exponents.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, one time he showed them the following equation:
<p>
<center><b><big>a<sup>b</sup> - b<sup>a</sup> = 0</big></b></center>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They quickly solved that as 4<sup>2</sup> - 2<sup>4</sup> = 0, because each power is 16.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This inspired the girls to invent their own "power" equations to challenge their uncle.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon Sheila shyly showed this one:  a<sup>b</sup> - b<sup>a</sup> = 118
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Sylvia slyly stated:  a<sup>b</sup> - b<sup>a</sup> = 7.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly Priscilla proudly pronounced: a<sup>b</sup> - b<sup>a</sup> = 1844.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be outdone by his nieces, he did so by stating the products of the <i>a</i>-value and the <i>b</i>-value for each case.  What did the wily old professor say?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Extra:</b>  As Mrs. Lazanu brought in some milk and cookies for everybody, she offered this little teaser: "When does a<sup>b</sup> and b<sup>a</sup> represent consecutive squares?"
