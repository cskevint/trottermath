&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherokee Creek Middle School has a checkers club.  Sad to say, they are in a bit of a slump this semester.  The members have only scored 40 wins out of 90 games to date in their various inter-school competitions..
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they found a new coach, who inspired them and significantly improved their overall level of play.  This month they went on a hot streak, winning 3 out of every 5 games played.  They now are quite happy at 52%.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many games did they play to achieve that great turn-around?
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra:  What is the minimum number of games that they must have played to first bring their percentage above 50%?
