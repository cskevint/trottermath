<img src="beachfun1.gif" width="150" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Periwinkle family likes to go to the beach whenever possible.  Recently during Labor Day they left their house early to enjoy some fun in the sun.  At 7:05, they were one-third of the way there.  Then at 7:25 they had traveled three-fourths of their drive.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time did the family leave their house?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>Extra:</i></b> If the distance to the beach was <i>32</i> miles, what was their average rate or speed of their automobile?
