<div align="left">�����My piggy bank has been my trusted repository for some time.  I have used it exclusively to save those little extra pennies, nickels, and dimes that I have received as change when I purchase things.</div>
<p>
<div align="left">�����One day I had need of some cash to buy some school supplies before going to classes, so I took "piggy" off my shelf, preparing to make a "withdrawal".  Just then my pesky little sister, Charlene, entered my room and said, "Oh, money!  Gimme some, will ya'?"</div>
<p>
<div align="left">�����Being the kind brother that I am, I said, "I'll make you a deal.  If you can guess how much is inside, with less than a 10% error, I'll give you a quarter.  How 'bout that?"</div>
<p>
<div align="left">�����With nothing to lose if she was wrong, "Charlie" shook the bank to hear the clink-clank of the coins, thought a moment, then said, "Ok.  I bet there is $3.50 inside."</div>
<p>
<div align="left">�����After counting out the money, we found that her guess was pretty good, though not perfect.  (But I gave her the quarter anyway; fair is fair, you know.)</div>
<p>
<div align="left">�����I would like for you to tell me how many of each type of coin was in the bank and how much I was left with after paying off my debt to her.  You have these facts to work with:</div>
<p>
<ul>
<li>14 coins were of one of the three types;
<li>16 2/3 % of them were of another type; and
<li>3/5 of them were of the third type.
</ul>
