&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dee's Donut Shoppe is THE place to buy the best donuts in my town.  As part of her promotion of business, Dee offers her customers a way to get some goodies free.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a customer has purchased 8 dozen of any type of donuts in the store, they may spin a large wheel that awards the person one of two things: a dozen of her famous "donut holes", or a <i>baker's dozen</i> of the same.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week 159 donut holes were given out to several customers.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many customers received the baker's dozen size?
<p>

<p>
<b>Extra:</b> The main question above only has one unique answer.  However, such is not always the case if the number of these pastries is larger.  What is the minimum number of customers that would be involved if 181 donut holes had been awarded?
