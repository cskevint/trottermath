&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tiffany plays first board on her middle school's chess team.  She had a good record last semester, winning 60% of her 50 tournament games.
<p>
<img src="chessgirl.gif" align="right">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After diligent study and lots of practice during the summer vacation, she has recently been on a hot streak this semester, winning 3 out of every 4 games she has played.  At the end of this winning streak, she had won two-thirds of all her games so far.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many total games has she played in both semesters?</font>
