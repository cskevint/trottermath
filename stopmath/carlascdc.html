&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My next-door neighbor's daughter, Carla Darlene Contreras, is a typical modern-day teenager.  This means, among other things, she's a big fan of popular music.
<p>
<img src="cdgroup.gif" align="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other day she was taking an inventory of her rather extensive collection of CD's that she listens to all the time.  She had divided it into 3 categories, explaining it to me in a very unusual mathematical way:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Forty percent of my CD's are made by female recording artists, and one-third of them by male singers," she said with a wink in her eye.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And that last group?" I inquired quizzically.

</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh, those CD's were done by groups.  There are 16 of them in that category." she promptly replied.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowing that information, tell me how many CD's Carla Darlene has in her possession.
