<img src="nutsvariety.gif" align="right">One week, she bought one pound of cashews and two pounds of pecans, and paid $2.40. The next week she bought four pounds of almonds and one pound of cashews, paying $3.60.  A week later she bought three pounds of walnuts, one pound of cashews and one pound of almonds for $2.10.
<p>
How much would she have to pay on her next trip to the grocery store, if she bought one pound of each of the four types of nuts?
