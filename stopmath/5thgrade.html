&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At three o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Forth started to give a lecture to a group of fifth-graders. There were fewer than 104 students present. There were three boys for every five girls. 
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 3:04 some students were asleep and some were awake. But by 3:05 <font color="red"><b>one-fifth</b></font> of those who had been awake had fallen asleep, and <font color="red"><b>one-fourth</b></font> of those who had been asleep were awake.
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were now as many students awake as asleep, how many fifth-graders were there? How many were boys, and how many were girls?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Extra:</b> How many students were awake and how many were asleep at 3:04 p.m.?
