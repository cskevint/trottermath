&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My neighbor has three pets in his home, all dogs.  Fifi is the little French poodle.  The name of his big St. Bernard is Maxx.  And, Sparky, the medium-sized dog, is, well, let's just say, he is of no particular breed.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week he took his beloved pets to the vet for their annual health check-ups and shots.  The doctor weighed them as part of the examination.  Upon returning home, my friend told me the animals' weights in an unusual way.  He said:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Together Fifi and Maxx weigh 72 pounds.<p>
<li>Maxx and Sparky have a combined weight of 86 pounds.<p>
<li>Lastly, the sum of Sparky and Fifi's weights are 35 pounds.
</ul>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me now how much each dog weighs, individually.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Extra</i>: Write an expression for the arithmetic mean of the dogs' weights.  Use the same variables you chose for the main problem.
