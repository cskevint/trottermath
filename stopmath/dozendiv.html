&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a nice little number trick to show your friends.  Just tell them to take out their calculators and follow these steps:
<p><blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Select any whole number they like and enter it into the calculator.
<p>
<li>Find the fourth power of that number, <i>i.e.</i> <big><b>x<sup>4</sup></b></big>.
<p>
<li>Find the square of the original number, <i>i.e.</i> <big><b>x<sup>2</sup></b></big>.
<p>
<li>Subtract the two results just obtained, <i>i.e.</i> <big><b>x<sup>4</sup> - x<sup>2</sup></b></big>.
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You now announce very proudly, & authoritatively, that the resulting difference is divisible by <b><big>12</big></b>.  The number in one dozen!
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further you can say that this will always be the result, no matter what the original number may be.  This is sure to amaze your friends, wouldn't you agree?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, remember that in mathematics, the existence of many examples does not say that something is always true, just that it might be true.  What is required in such a case is a true proof, an algebraic one, that is.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your task now before you is to (1) demonstrate this trick with 2 numbers of your choice, and (2) find a good and convincing algebraic proof that <i>the positive difference of the fourth power and square of any integer is divisible by 12.</i>
