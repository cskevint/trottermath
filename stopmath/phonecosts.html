&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A popular commercial for long-distance telephone calls says their rate is just "7¢ per minute", thus being better than those other companies that charge 10¢ and 25¢.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently there comes another commercial that says "our rate is just 3¢ per minute and 39¢ to connect".  Sounds great, doesn't it?  But is it?
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you only needed to make a short call to someone, the first plan would actually be cheaper.  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's compare these two plans algebraically.
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What is the <i>break-even point</i>, i.e. the length of time for which the cost is the same for both plans?  What would the amount be?
<p>
<li>How long would a customer have to talk so that she would be charged <b>twice</b> as much money for the first plan, as compared to the second one?
<p></blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i><big>Extra:</big></i></b> When would the first plan be <i>three times</i> as high as the second?
